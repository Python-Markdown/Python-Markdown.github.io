It is almost completely compliant with the reference implementation, though there are a few very minor differences . See John\u2019s Syntax Documentation for the syntax rules. To get started, see the installation instructions , the library reference , and the command line interface . Goals \u00b6 The Python-Markdown project is developed with the following goals in mind: Maintain a Python library (with an optional CLI wrapper) suited to use in web server environments (never raise an exception, never write to stdout, etc.) as an implementation of the markdown parser that follows the syntax rules and the behavior of the original (markdown.pl) implementation as reasonably as possible (see differences for a few exceptions). Provide an Extension API which makes it possible to change and/or extend the behavior of the parser. Features \u00b6 In addition to the basic markdown syntax, Python-Markdown supports the following features: International Input Python-Markdown will accept input in any language supported by Unicode including bi-directional text. In fact the test suite includes documents written in Russian and Arabic. Extensions Various extensions are provided (including extra ) to change and/or extend the base syntax. Additionally, a public Extension API is available to write your own extensions. Output Formats Python-Markdown can output documents with either HTML or XHTML style tags. See the Library Reference for details. Command Line Interface In addition to being a Python Library, a command line script is available for your convenience. Differences \u00b6 While Python-Markdown strives to fully implement markdown as described in the syntax rules , the rules can be interpreted in different ways and different implementations occasionally vary in their behavior (see the Babelmark FAQ for some examples). Known and intentional differences found in Python-Markdown are summarized below: Middle-Word Emphasis Python-Markdown defaults to ignoring middle-word emphasis (and strong emphasis). In other words, some_long_filename.txt will not become some<em>long</em>filename.txt . This can be switched off if desired. See the Legacy EM Extension for details. Indentation/Tab Length The syntax rules clearly state that when a list item consists of multiple paragraphs, \u201ceach subsequent paragraph in a list item must be indented by either 4 spaces or one tab\u201d (emphasis added). However, many implementations do not enforce this rule and allow less than 4 spaces of indentation. The implementers of Python-Markdown consider it a bug to not enforce this rule. This applies to any block level elements nested in a list, including paragraphs, sub-lists, blockquotes, code blocks, etc. They must always be indented by at least four spaces (or one tab) for each level of nesting. In the event that one would prefer different behavior, tab_length can be set to whatever length is desired. Be warned however, as this will affect indentation for all aspects of the syntax (including root level code blocks). Alternatively, a third party extension may offer a solution that meets your needs. Consecutive Lists While the syntax rules are not clear on this, many implementations (including the original) do not end one list and start a second list when the list marker (asterisks, pluses, hyphens, and numbers) changes. For consistency, Python-Markdown maintains the same behavior with no plans to change in the foreseeable future. That said, the Sane List Extension is available to provide a less surprising behavior.

While there are many other command line implementations of Markdown, you may not have them installed, or you may prefer to use Python-Markdown\u2019s various extensions. Generally, you will want to have the Markdown library fully installed on your system to run the command line script. See the Installation instructions for details. Python-Markdown\u2019s command line script takes advantage of Python\u2019s -m flag. Therefore, assuming the python executable is on your system path, use the following format: python -m markdown [ options ] [ args ] That will run the module as a script with the options and arguments provided. At its most basic usage, one would simply pass in a file name as the only argument: python -m markdown input_file.txt Piping input and output (on STDIN and STDOUT ) is fully supported as well. For example: echo \"Some **Markdown** text.\" | python -m markdown > output.html Use the --help option for a list all available options and arguments: python -m markdown --help If you don\u2019t want to call the python executable directly (using the -m flag), follow the instructions below to use a wrapper script: Setup \u00b6 Upon installation, the markdown_py script will have been copied to your Python \u201cScripts\u201d directory. Different systems require different methods to ensure that any files in the Python \u201cScripts\u201d directory are on your system path. Windows : Assuming a default install of Python on Windows, your \u201cScripts\u201d directory is most likely something like C:\\\\Python37\\Scripts . Verify the location of your \u201cScripts\u201d directory and add it to you system path. Calling markdown_py from the command line will call the wrapper batch file markdown_py.bat in the \"Scripts\" directory created during install. *nix (Linux, OSX, BSD, Unix, etc.): As each *nix distribution is different and we can\u2019t possibly document all of them here, we\u2019ll provide a few helpful pointers: Some systems will automatically install the script on your path. Try it and see if it works. Just run markdown_py from the command line. Other systems may maintain a separate \u201cScripts\u201d (\u201cbin\u201d) directory which you need to add to your path. Find it (check with your distribution) and either add it to your path or make a symbolic link to it from your path. If you are sure markdown_py is on your path, but it still is not being found, check the permissions of the file and make sure it is executable. As an alternative, you could just cd into the directory which contains the source distribution, and run it from there. However, remember that your markdown text files will not likely be in that directory, so it is much more convenient to have markdown_py on your path. Note Python-Markdown uses \"markdown_py\" as a script name because the Perl implementation has already taken the more obvious name \u201cmarkdown\u201d. Additionally, the default Python configuration on some systems would cause a script named \"markdown.py\" to fail by importing itself rather than the markdown library. Therefore, the script has been named \"markdown_py\" as a compromise. If you prefer a different name for the script on your system, it is suggested that you create a symbolic link to markdown_py with your preferred name. Usage \u00b6 To use markdown_py from the command line, run it as markdown_py input_file.txt or markdown_py input_file.txt > output_file.html For a complete list of options, run markdown_py --help Using Extensions \u00b6 To load a Python-Markdown extension from the command line use the -x (or --extension ) option. The extension module must be on your PYTHONPATH (see the Extension API for details). The extension can then be invoked by the name assigned to an entry point or using Python\u2019s dot notation to point to an extension For example, to load an extension with the assigned entry point name myext , run the following command: python -m markdown -x myext input.txt And to load an extension with Python\u2019s dot notation: python -m markdown -x path.to.module:MyExtClass input.txt To load multiple extensions, specify an -x option for each extension: python -m markdown -x myext -x path.to.module:MyExtClass input.txt If the extension supports configuration options (see the documentation for the extension you are using to determine what settings it supports, if any), you can pass them in as well: python -m markdown -x myext -c config.yml input.txt The -c (or --extension_configs ) option accepts a file name. The file must be in either the YAML or JSON format and contain YAML or JSON data that would map to a Python Dictionary in the format required by the extension_configs keyword of the markdown.Markdown class. Therefore, the file config.yaml referenced in the above example might look like this: myext : option1 : 'value1' option2 : True Similarly, a JSON configuration file might look like this: { \"myext\" : { \"option1\" : \"value1\" , \"option2\" : \"value2\" } } Note that while the --extension_configs option does specify the myext extension, you still need to load the extension with the -x option, or the configuration for that extension will be ignored. Further, if an extension requires a value that cannot be parsed in JSON (for example a reference to a function), one has to use a YAML configuration file. The --extension_configs option will only support YAML configuration files if PyYAML is installed on your system. JSON should work with no additional dependencies.

These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request. Code of Conduct \u00b6 This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the Python-Markdown Code of Conduct . By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to python.markdown@gmail.com . Project Organization \u00b6 The core Python-Markdown code base and any built-in extensions are hosted in the Python-Markdown/markdown project on GitHub. Other extensions maintained by the Python-Markdown project may be hosted as separate repositories in the Python-Markdown Organization on GitHub and must follow best practices for third-party extensions. The Python-Markdown/markdown project is organized as follows: Branch master should generally be stable and release-ready at all times. Version branches should be used for bug-fixes back-ported to the most recent PATCH release. No other branches should be created. Any other branches which exist are preserved for historical reasons only. Issues \u00b6 Feature requests, bug reports, usage questions, and other issues can all be raised on the GitHub issue tracker . When describing issues try to phrase your ticket in terms of the behavior you think needs to change rather than the code you think needs to change. Make sure you\u2019re running the latest version of Python-Markdown before reporting an issue. Search the issue list first for related items. Be sure to check closed issues and pull requests. GitHub\u2019s search only checks open issues by default. You may want to check the syntax rules and/or Babelmark to confirm that your expectations align with the rules and/or other implementations of Markdown. If reporting a syntax bug, you must provide the minimal input which exhibits the behavior, the actual output and the output you expected. All three items must be provided as textual code blocks (screen-shots are not helpful). It may also be helpful to point to the syntax rules which specifically address the area of concern. Feature requests will often be closed with a recommendation that they be implemented as third party extensions outside of the core Python-Markdown library. Keeping new feature requests implemented as third party extensions allows us to keep the maintenance overhead of Python-Markdown to a minimum, so that the focus can be on continued stability, bug fixes, and documentation. Closing an issue does not necessarily mean the end of a discussion. If you believe your issue has been closed incorrectly, explain why and we\u2019ll consider if it needs to be reopened. Pull Requests \u00b6 A pull request often represents the start of a discussion, and does not necessarily need to be the final, finished submission. In fact, if you discover an issue and intend to provide a fix for it, there is no need to open an issue first. You can report the issue and provide the fix together in a pull request. All pull requests should be made from your personal fork of the library hosted in your personal GitHub account. Do not create branches on the Python-Markdown/markdown project for pull requests. All pull requests should be implemented in a new branch with a unique name. Remember that if you have an outstanding pull request, pushing new commits to the related branch of your GitHub repository will also automatically update the pull request. It may help to review GitHub\u2019s documentation on Creating a pull request from a fork . If you are providing a fix for a previously reported issue, you must reference the issue in your commit message. Be sure to prefix the reference with one of GitHub\u2019s action words which will automatically close the issue when the pull request is merged. For example, fixes #42 and closes #42 would be acceptable, whereas ref #42 would not. Of course, if merging a pull request should not cause an issue to be closed, then the action word should not be included when referencing that issue. Before being accepted, each pull request must include the applicable code, new tests of all new features, updated tests for any changed features, documentation updates, and an appropriate update to the release notes. All changes must follow the applicable style guides. Failure to meet any one of the requirements is likely to delay any serious consideration of your pull request and may even cause it to be closed. Of course, if you are in the early stages of development, you may include a note in the pull request acknowledging that it is incomplete along with a request for feedback. Pull requests will generally not be accepted if any tests are failing. Therefore, it is recommended that you run the tests before submitting your pull request. After making a pull request, check the build status in the GitHub interface to ensure that all tests are running as expected. If any checks fail, you may push additional commits to your branch. GitHub will add those commits to the pull request and rerun the checks. Style Guides \u00b6 In an effort to maintain consistency, Python-Markdown adheres to the following style guides in its code and documentation. A pull request may be rejected if it fails to match the relevant style guides. Code Style Guide \u00b6 Except as noted below, all pull requests should follow Python\u2019s standard PEP8 Style Guide and are run through Flake8 to ensure that the style guide is followed. Legacy code which does not follow the guidelines should only be updated if and when other changes (bug fix, feature addition, etc.) are being made to that section of code. While new features should be given names that follow modern Python naming conventions, existing names should be preserved to avoid backward incompatible changes. Line length is limited to a maximum of 119 characters. When a line of code does not fit within the line length limit, continuation lines should align elements wrapped inside parentheses, brackets and braces using a hanging indent . When using a hanging indent there should be no arguments on the first line and further indentation should be used to clearly distinguish itself as a continuation line. The closing parenthesis, bracket or brace should be on a line by itself and should line up under the first character of the line that starts the multi-line construct. my_list = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , ] result = some_function_that_takes_arguments ( 'a' , 'b' , 'c' , 'd' , 'e' , 'f' , ) When the conditional part of an if -statement is long enough to require that it be written across multiple lines, extra indentation should be included on the conditional continuation line. if ( this_is_one_thing and that_is_another_thing ): do_something () Documentation Style Guide \u00b6 Documentation should be in American English. The tone of the documentation should be simple, plain, objective and well-balanced where possible. Keep paragraphs reasonably short. With the exception of code blocks, limit line length to 79 characters. You may want to use your editor\u2019s tools to automatically hard wrap lines of text. Don\u2019t use abbreviations such as \u2018e.g.\u2019 but instead use the long form, such as \u2018For example\u2019. The documentation is built from the Markdown source files in the docs directory by the MkDocs static site generator. In addition to the basic Markdown syntax, the following extensions are supported: extra , admonition , smarty , codehilite , and toc . There are a few conventions you should follow when working on the documentation. Headers \u00b6 Headers should use the hash style. For example: ## Some important topic The underline style should not be used. Don\u2019t do this: Some important topic ==================== Links \u00b6 Links should always use the reference style, with the referenced hyperlinks kept at the end of the document. Here is a link to [ some other thing ][ other-thing ]. More text... [ other-thing ]: http://example.com/other/thing This style helps keep the documentation source consistent and readable. If you are linking to another document within Python-Markdown\u2019s documentation, you should use a relative link, and link to the .md suffix. If applicable, it is preferred that the link includes a hash fragment pointing to the specific section of the page. For example: [ authentication ]: reference.md#Markdown Linking in this style ensures that the links work when browsing the documentation on GitHub. If your Markdown editor makes links clickable, they will work there as well. When the documentation is built, these links will be converted into regular links which point to the built HTML pages. Notes and Warnings \u00b6 If you want to draw attention to a note or warning, use the syntax defined in Python-Markdown\u2019s Admonition Extension : !!! note This is the content of the note. Commit Message Style Guide \u00b6 Use the present tense (\u201cAdd feature\u201d not \u201cAdded feature\u201d). Use the imperative mood (\u201cMove item to\u2026\u201d not \u201cMoves item to\u2026\u201d). Limit the first line to 72 characters or less. Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line. Include a summary of the changes/additions made without replicating the content of the documentation or release notes. This is where an explanation of the choices made should be found. References to issues and pull requests should only provide the context in which a choice was made. However, the commit should be able to stand on its own. Development Environment \u00b6 To start developing on Python-Markdown is it best to create a fork of the project on GitHub. After cloning your fork to your local system, you will want to configure a remote that points to the upstream repository so that you can sync changes made in the original repository with your fork. It is recommended that all development be done from within a Python virtual environment , which isolates any experimental code from the general system. To create a virtual environment, use the following command from the root of the local working copy of your GitHub fork: virtualenv venv That creates a virtual environment which is contained in the venv directory within your local working copy. Note that the repository is configured so that git will ignore any files within a directory named venv or ENV for this very reason. On Posix systems (Linux, BSD, MacOS, etc.), use the following command to activate the environment: source venv/bin/activate On Windows, use this command instead: venv/Scripts/activate See the User Guide for more information on using virtual environments. To be able to run the Markdown library directly while working on it, install the working copy into the environment in Development Mode after activating the virtual environment for the first time: pip install --editable . Now any saved changes will immediately be available within the virtual environment. You can run the command line script with the following command: python -m markdown And you can directly run the tests with: python -m unittest discover tests Note Some tests require the PyTidyLib library, which depends on the HTML Tidy library. If you do not have PyTidyLib installed, the tests which depend upon it will be skipped. Given the difficulty in installing the HTML Tidy library on many systems, you may choose to leave both libraries uninstalled and depend on the Travis server to run those tests when you submit a pull request. The above setup will only run tests against the code in one version of Python. However, Python-Markdown supports multiple versions of Python. Therefore, a tox configuration is included in the repository, which includes test environments for all supported Python versions, a Flake8 test environment, and a spellchecker for the documentation. While it is generally fine to leave those tests for the Travis server to run when a pull request is submitted, for more advanced changes, you may want to run those tests locally. To do so, simply install tox: pip install tox Then, to run all configured test environments, simply call the command tox with no arguments. See help ( tox -h ) for more options. Note The tox environments expect that some dependencies are already installed on your system. For example, by default, any Python version specific environment will fail if that version of Python is not installed. Additionally, the tox environments assume that the HTML Tidy library is installed and may fail when attempting to install PyTidyLib if it is not. Finally, the spellchecker environment requires aspell and the aspell-en dictionary to be installed. Unfortunately, installing those dependencies may differ significantly from system to system and is outside the scope of this guide. See Also Python-Markdown provides test tools which simply testing Markdown syntax. Understanding those tools will often help in understanding why a test may be failing. Versions \u00b6 Python-Markdown follows Semantic Versioning and uses the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[.dev#|a#|b#|rc#] format for identifying releases. The status of the master branch should always be identified in the __version_info__ tuple defined in markdown/__meta__.py . The contents of that tuple will automatically be converted into a normalized version which conforms to PEP 440 . An invalid __version_info__ tuple will raise an error, preventing the library from running and the package from building. Version Status \u00b6 A MAJOR version is in development status when the MINOR version is 0 , the PATCH version is 0 , and the version includes a dev segment. A MINOR version is in development status when the MINOR version is not 0 , the PATCH version is 0 , and the version includes a dev segment. At all other times, the code is considered stable and release-ready. MAJOR and MINOR releases may or may not get pre-releases (alpha, beta, release candidate, etc.) at the discretion of the project maintainers. Version Workflow \u00b6 Bug fixes may be merged from a pull request to the master branch at any time so long as all tests pass, including one or more new tests which would have failed prior to the change. New features and backward incompatible changes may only be merged to the master branch when the MAJOR and/or MINOR version is in development status pursuant to Semantic Versioning . A separate commit to the master branch should be made to bump up the MAJOR and/or MINOR version and set development status. Only then will any pull requests implementing new features or backward incompatible changes be accepted. If a bug fix is deemed to be important and the master branch is in development status, a back-port of the fix should be committed to a version branch. If the appropriate version branch does not exist, then it should be created and a pull request back-porting the fix made against that branch. The version branch should be named with the most recently released MINOR version. For example, if the master branch is at 3.1.dev0 and the most recent MINOR release was 3.0.4 , then the version branch would be named 3.0 and any releases from that branch would increment the PATCH version only ( 3.0.5 , 3.0.6 \u2026). Release Process \u00b6 When a new release is being prepared, the release manager should follow the following steps: Verify that all outstanding issues and pull requests related to the release have been resolved. Confirm that the release notes and change log have been updated and indicate the date of the new release. Update the version defined in markdown/__meta__.py . Build a local copy of the documentation, browse through the pages and confirm that no obvious issues exist with the documentation. Create a pull request with a commit message in the following format: Bump version to X . X . X After all checks have passed, merge the pull request. Create a git tag with the new version as the tag name and push to the Python-Markdown/markdown repository. The new tag should trigger a GitHub workflow which will automatically deploy the release to PyPI and update the documentation. In the event that the deployment fails, the following steps can be taken to deploy manually: Deploy the release to PyPI with the command make deploy . Deploy an update to the documentation using MkDocs . The following example assumes that local clones of the Python-Markdown/markdown and Python-Markdown/Python-Markdown.github.io repositories are in sibling directories named markdown and Python-Markdown.github.io respectively. cd Python - Markdown . github . io mkdocs gh - deploy --config-file ../markdown/mkdocs.yml --remote-branch master Issue and Pull Request Labels \u00b6 Below are the labels used to track and manages issues and pull requests.

When describing issues try to phrase your ticket in terms of the behavior you think needs to change rather than the code you think needs to change. Make sure you\u2019re running the latest version of Python-Markdown before reporting an issue. Search the issue list first for related items. Be sure to check closed issues and pull requests. GitHub\u2019s search only checks open issues by default. You may want to check the syntax rules and/or Babelmark to confirm that your expectations align with the rules and/or other implementations of Markdown. If reporting a syntax bug, you must provide the minimal input which exhibits the behavior, the actual output and the output you expected. All three items must be provided as textual code blocks (screen-shots are not helpful). It may also be helpful to point to the syntax rules which specifically address the area of concern. Feature requests will often be closed with a recommendation that they be implemented as third party extensions outside of the core Python-Markdown library. Keeping new feature requests implemented as third party extensions allows us to keep the maintenance overhead of Python-Markdown to a minimum, so that the focus can be on continued stability, bug fixes, and documentation.

In fact, if you discover an issue and intend to provide a fix for it, there is no need to open an issue first. You can report the issue and provide the fix together in a pull request. All pull requests should be made from your personal fork of the library hosted in your personal GitHub account. Do not create branches on the Python-Markdown/markdown project for pull requests. All pull requests should be implemented in a new branch with a unique name. Remember that if you have an outstanding pull request, pushing new commits to the related branch of your GitHub repository will also automatically update the pull request. It may help to review GitHub\u2019s documentation on Creating a pull request from a fork . If you are providing a fix for a previously reported issue, you must reference the issue in your commit message. Be sure to prefix the reference with one of GitHub\u2019s action words which will automatically close the issue when the pull request is merged. For example, fixes #42 and closes #42 would be acceptable, whereas ref #42 would not. Of course, if merging a pull request should not cause an issue to be closed, then the action word should not be included when referencing that issue. Before being accepted, each pull request must include the applicable code, new tests of all new features, updated tests for any changed features, documentation updates, and an appropriate update to the release notes. All changes must follow the applicable style guides. Failure to meet any one of the requirements is likely to delay any serious consideration of your pull request and may even cause it to be closed. Of course, if you are in the early stages of development, you may include a note in the pull request acknowledging that it is incomplete along with a request for feedback. Pull requests will generally not be accepted if any tests are failing. Therefore, it is recommended that you run the tests before submitting your pull request. After making a pull request, check the build status in the GitHub interface to ensure that all tests are running as expected. If any checks fail, you may push additional commits to your branch.

After cloning your fork to your local system, you will want to configure a remote that points to the upstream repository so that you can sync changes made in the original repository with your fork. It is recommended that all development be done from within a Python virtual environment , which isolates any experimental code from the general system. To create a virtual environment, use the following command from the root of the local working copy of your GitHub fork: virtualenv venv That creates a virtual environment which is contained in the venv directory within your local working copy. Note that the repository is configured so that git will ignore any files within a directory named venv or ENV for this very reason. On Posix systems (Linux, BSD, MacOS, etc.), use the following command to activate the environment: source venv/bin/activate On Windows, use this command instead: venv/Scripts/activate See the User Guide for more information on using virtual environments. To be able to run the Markdown library directly while working on it, install the working copy into the environment in Development Mode after activating the virtual environment for the first time: pip install --editable . Now any saved changes will immediately be available within the virtual environment. You can run the command line script with the following command: python -m markdown And you can directly run the tests with: python -m unittest discover tests Note Some tests require the PyTidyLib library, which depends on the HTML Tidy library. If you do not have PyTidyLib installed, the tests which depend upon it will be skipped. Given the difficulty in installing the HTML Tidy library on many systems, you may choose to leave both libraries uninstalled and depend on the Travis server to run those tests when you submit a pull request. The above setup will only run tests against the code in one version of Python. However, Python-Markdown supports multiple versions of Python. Therefore, a tox configuration is included in the repository, which includes test environments for all supported Python versions, a Flake8 test environment, and a spellchecker for the documentation. While it is generally fine to leave those tests for the Travis server to run when a pull request is submitted, for more advanced changes, you may want to run those tests locally. To do so, simply install tox: pip install tox Then, to run all configured test environments, simply call the command tox with no arguments. See help ( tox -h ) for more options. Note The tox environments expect that some dependencies are already installed on your system. For example, by default, any Python version specific environment will fail if that version of Python is not installed. Additionally, the tox environments assume that the HTML Tidy library is installed and may fail when attempting to install PyTidyLib if it is not.

The Basics \u00b6 To use markdown as a module: import markdown html = markdown . markdown ( your_text_string ) The Details \u00b6 Python-Markdown provides two public functions ( markdown.markdown and markdown.markdownFromFile ) both of which wrap the public class markdown.Markdown . If you\u2019re processing one document at a time, these functions will serve your needs. However, if you need to process multiple documents, it may be advantageous to create a single instance of the markdown.Markdown class and pass multiple documents through it. If you do use a single instance though, make sure to call the reset method appropriately ( see below ). markdown.markdown(text [, **kwargs]) \u00b6 The following options are available on the markdown.markdown function: text The source Unicode string. (required) Important Python-Markdown expects a Unicode string as input (some simple ASCII binary strings may work only by coincidence) and returns output as a Unicode string. Do not pass binary strings to it! If your input is encoded, (e.g. as UTF-8), it is your responsibility to decode it. For example: with open ( \"some_file.txt\" , \"r\" , encoding = \"utf-8\" ) as input_file : text = input_file . read () html = markdown . markdown ( text ) If you want to write the output to disk, you must encode it yourself: with open ( \"some_file.html\" , \"w\" , encoding = \"utf-8\" , errors = \"xmlcharrefreplace\" ) as output_file : output_file . write ( html ) extensions A list of extensions. Python-Markdown provides an API for third parties to write extensions to the parser adding their own additions or changes to the syntax. A few commonly used extensions are shipped with the markdown library. See the extension documentation for a list of available extensions. The list of extensions may contain instances of extensions and/or strings of extension names. extensions = [ MyExtClass (), 'myext' , 'path.to.my.ext:MyExtClass' ] Note The preferred method is to pass in an instance of an extension. Strings should only be used when it is impossible to import the Extension Class directly (from the command line or in a template). When passing in extension instances, each class instance must be a subclass of markdown.extensions.Extension and any configuration options should be defined when initiating the class instance rather than using the extension_configs keyword. For example: from markdown.extensions import Extension class MyExtClass ( Extension ): # define your extension here... markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ MyExtClass ( option = 'value' )]) If an extension name is provided as a string, the string must either be the registered entry point of any installed extension or the importable path using Python\u2019s dot notation. See the documentation specific to an extension for the string name assigned to an extension as an entry point. Simply include the defined name as a string in the list of extensions. For example, if an extension has the name myext assigned to it and the extension is properly installed, then do the following: markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ 'myext' ]) If an extension does not have a registered entry point, Python\u2019s dot notation may be used instead. The extension must be installed as a Python module on your PYTHONPATH. Generally, a class should be specified in the name. The class must be at the end of the name and be separated by a colon from the module. Therefore, if you were to import the class like this: from path.to.module import MyExtClass Then load the extension as follows: markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ 'path.to.module:MyExtClass' ]) If only one extension is defined within a module and the module includes a makeExtension function which returns an instance of the extension, then the class name is not necessary. For example, in that case one could do extensions=['path.to.module'] . Check the documentation for a specific extension to determine if it supports this feature. When loading an extension by name (as a string), you can only pass in configuration settings to the extension by using the extension_configs keyword. See Also See the documentation of the Extension API for assistance in creating extensions. extension_configs A dictionary of configuration settings for extensions. Any configuration settings will only be passed to extensions loaded by name (as a string). When loading extensions as class instances, pass the configuration settings directly to the class when initializing it. Note The preferred method is to pass in an instance of an extension, which does not require use of the extension_configs keyword at all. See the extensions keyword for details. The dictionary of configuration settings must be in the following format: extension_configs = { 'extension_name_1' : { 'option_1' : 'value_1' , 'option_2' : 'value_2' }, 'extension_name_2' : { 'option_1' : 'value_1' } } When specifying the extension name, be sure to use the exact same string as is used in the extensions keyword to load the extension. Otherwise, the configuration settings will not be applied to the extension. In other words, you cannot use the entry point in on place and Python dot notation in the other. While both may be valid for a given extension, they will not be recognized as being the same extension by Markdown. See the documentation specific to the extension you are using for help in specifying configuration settings for that extension. output_format : Format of output. Supported formats are: \"xhtml\" : Outputs XHTML style tags. Default . \"html5\" : Outputs HTML style tags. The values can be in either lowercase or uppercase. tab_length : Length of tabs in the source. Default: 4 markdown.markdownFromFile (**kwargs) \u00b6 With a few exceptions, markdown.markdownFromFile accepts the same options as markdown.markdown . It does not accept a text (or Unicode) string. Instead, it accepts the following required options: input (required) The source text file. input may be set to one of three options: a string which contains a path to a readable file on the file system, a readable file-like object, or None (default) which will read from stdin . output The target which output is written to. output may be set to one of three options: a string which contains a path to a writable file on the file system, a writable file-like object, or None (default) which will write to stdout . encoding The encoding of the source text file. Defaults to \"utf-8\" . The same encoding will always be used for input and output. The xmlcharrefreplace error handler is used when encoding the output. Note This is the only place that decoding and encoding of Unicode takes place in Python-Markdown.

(required) Important Python-Markdown expects a Unicode string as input (some simple ASCII binary strings may work only by coincidence) and returns output as a Unicode string. Do not pass binary strings to it! If your input is encoded, (e.g. as UTF-8), it is your responsibility to decode it. For example: with open ( \"some_file.txt\" , \"r\" , encoding = \"utf-8\" ) as input_file : text = input_file . read () html = markdown . markdown ( text ) If you want to write the output to disk, you must encode it yourself: with open ( \"some_file.html\" , \"w\" , encoding = \"utf-8\" , errors = \"xmlcharrefreplace\" ) as output_file : output_file . write ( html ) extensions A list of extensions. Python-Markdown provides an API for third parties to write extensions to the parser adding their own additions or changes to the syntax. A few commonly used extensions are shipped with the markdown library. See the extension documentation for a list of available extensions. The list of extensions may contain instances of extensions and/or strings of extension names. extensions = [ MyExtClass (), 'myext' , 'path.to.my.ext:MyExtClass' ] Note The preferred method is to pass in an instance of an extension. Strings should only be used when it is impossible to import the Extension Class directly (from the command line or in a template). When passing in extension instances, each class instance must be a subclass of markdown.extensions.Extension and any configuration options should be defined when initiating the class instance rather than using the extension_configs keyword. For example: from markdown.extensions import Extension class MyExtClass ( Extension ): # define your extension here... markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ MyExtClass ( option = 'value' )]) If an extension name is provided as a string, the string must either be the registered entry point of any installed extension or the importable path using Python\u2019s dot notation. See the documentation specific to an extension for the string name assigned to an extension as an entry point. Simply include the defined name as a string in the list of extensions. For example, if an extension has the name myext assigned to it and the extension is properly installed, then do the following: markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ 'myext' ]) If an extension does not have a registered entry point, Python\u2019s dot notation may be used instead. The extension must be installed as a Python module on your PYTHONPATH. Generally, a class should be specified in the name. The class must be at the end of the name and be separated by a colon from the module. Therefore, if you were to import the class like this: from path.to.module import MyExtClass Then load the extension as follows: markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ 'path.to.module:MyExtClass' ]) If only one extension is defined within a module and the module includes a makeExtension function which returns an instance of the extension, then the class name is not necessary. For example, in that case one could do extensions=['path.to.module'] . Check the documentation for a specific extension to determine if it supports this feature. When loading an extension by name (as a string), you can only pass in configuration settings to the extension by using the extension_configs keyword. See Also See the documentation of the Extension API for assistance in creating extensions. extension_configs A dictionary of configuration settings for extensions. Any configuration settings will only be passed to extensions loaded by name (as a string). When loading extensions as class instances, pass the configuration settings directly to the class when initializing it. Note The preferred method is to pass in an instance of an extension, which does not require use of the extension_configs keyword at all. See the extensions keyword for details. The dictionary of configuration settings must be in the following format: extension_configs = { 'extension_name_1' : { 'option_1' : 'value_1' , 'option_2' : 'value_2' }, 'extension_name_2' : { 'option_1' : 'value_1' } } When specifying the extension name, be sure to use the exact same string as is used in the extensions keyword to load the extension. Otherwise, the configuration settings will not be applied to the extension. In other words, you cannot use the entry point in on place and Python dot notation in the other. While both may be valid for a given extension, they will not be recognized as being the same extension by Markdown. See the documentation specific to the extension you are using for help in specifying configuration settings for that extension. output_format : Format of output.

The tools are built on the Python standard library unittest . Therefore, no additional libraries are required. While Python-Markdown uses the tools for its own tests, they were designed and built so that third party extensions could use them as well. Therefore, the tools are importable from markdown.test_tools . The test tools include two different unittest.TestCase subclasses: markdown.test_tools.TestCase and markdown.test_tools.LegacyTestCase . markdown.test_tools.TestCase \u00b6 The markdown.test_tools.TestCase class is a unittest.TestCase subclass with a few additional helpers to make testing Markdown output easier. Properties default_kwargs : A dict of keywords to pass to Markdown for each test. The defaults can be overridden on individual tests. Methods assertMarkdownRenders : accepts the source text, the expected output, an optional dictionary of expected_attrs , and any keywords to pass to Markdown. The default_kwargs defined on the class are used except where overridden by keyword arguments. The output and expected output are passed to TestCase.assertMultiLineEqual . An AssertionError is raised with a diff if the actual output does not equal the expected output. The optional keyword expected_attrs accepts a dictionary of attribute names as keys with expected values. Each value is checked against the attribute of that name on the instance of the Markdown class using TestCase.assertEqual . An AssertionError is raised if any value does not match the expected value. dedent : Dedent triple-quoted strings. In all other respects, markdown.test_tools.TestCase behaves as unittest.TestCase . In fact, assertMarkdownRenders tests could be mixed with other unittest style tests within the same test class. An example Markdown test might look like this: from markdown.test_tools import TestCase class TestHr ( TestCase ): def test_hr_before_paragraph ( self ): self . assertMarkdownRenders ( # The Markdown source text used as input self . dedent ( \"\"\" *** An HR followed by a paragraph with no blank line. \"\"\" ), # The expected HTML output self . dedent ( \"\"\" <hr> <p>An HR followed by a paragraph with no blank line.</p> \"\"\" ), # Other keyword arguments to pass to `markdown.markdown` output_format = 'html' ) markdown.test_tools.LegacyTestCase \u00b6 In the past Python-Markdown exclusively used file-based tests. Many of those tests still exist in Python-Markdown\u2019s test suite, including the test files from the reference implementation ( markdown.pl ) and PHP Markdown . Each test consists of a matching pair of text and HTML files. The text file contains a snippet of Markdown source text formatted for a specific syntax feature and the HTML file contains the expected HTML output of that snippet. When the test suite is run, each text file is run through Markdown and the output is compared with the HTML file as a separate unit test. When a test fails, the error report includes a diff of the expected output compared to the actual output to easily identify any problems. A separate markdown.test_tools.LegacyTestCase subclass must be created for each directory of test files. Various properties can be defined within the subclass to point to a directory of text-based test files and define various behaviors/defaults for those tests. The following properties are supported: location : A path to the directory of test files. An absolute path is preferred. exclude : A list of tests to skip. Each test name should comprise of a file name without an extension. normalize : A boolean value indicating if the HTML should be normalized. Default: False . Note: Normalization of HTML requires that PyTidyLib be installed on the system. If PyTidyLib is not installed and normalize is set to True , then the test will be skipped, regardless of any other settings. input_ext : A string containing the file extension of input files. Default: .txt . output_ext : A string containing the file extension of expected output files. Default: html . default_kwargs : A markdown.test_tools.Kwargs instance which stores the default set of keyword arguments for all test files in the directory. In addition, properties can be defined for each individual set of test files within the directory. The property should be given the name of the file without the file extension. Any spaces and dashes in the file name should be replaced with underscores. The value of the property should be a markdown.test_tools.Kwargs instance which contains the keyword arguments that should be passed to markdown.markdown for that test file. The keyword arguments will \u201cupdate\u201d the default_kwargs . When the class instance is created during a test run, it will walk the given directory and create a separate unit test for each set of test files using the naming scheme: test_filename . One unit test will be run for each set of input and output files. The definition of an example set of tests might look like this: from markdown.test_tools import LegacyTestCase , Kwargs import os # Get location of this file and use to find text file dirs. parent_test_dir = os . path . abspath ( os . path . dirname ( __file__ )) class TestFoo ( LegacyTestCase ): # Define location of text file directory. In this case, the directory is # named \"foo\" and is in the same parent directory as this file. location = os . path . join ( parent_test_dir , 'foo' ) # Define default keyword arguments. In this case, unless specified # differently, all tests should use the output format \"html\". default_kwargs = Kwargs ( output_format = 'html' ) # The \"xhtml\" test should override the output format and use \"xhtml\". xhtml = Kwargs ( output_format = 'xhtml' ) # The \"toc\" test should use the \"toc\" extension with a custom permalink # setting. toc = Kwargs ( extensions = [ 'markdown.extensions.toc' ], extension_configs = { 'markdown.extensions.toc' : { 'permalink' : \"[link]\" }} ) Note that in the above example, the text file directory may contain many more text-based test files than xhtml ( xhtml.txt and xhtml.html ) and toc ( toc.txt and toc.html ). As long as each set of files exists as a pair, a test will be created and run for each of them. Only the xhtml and toc tests needed to be specifically identified as they had specific, non-default settings which needed to be defined. Running Python-Markdown\u2019s Tests \u00b6 As all of the tests for the markdown library are unit tests, standard unittest methods of calling tests can be used. For example, to run all of Python-Markdown\u2019s tests, from the root of the git repository, run the following command: python -m unittest discover tests That simple command will search everything in the tests directory and it\u2019s sub-directories and run all unittest tests that it finds, including unittest.TestCase , markdown.test_tools.TestCase , and markdown.test_tools.LegacyTestCase subclasses.

We have rewritten significant portions of the code, dramatically extending the extension API, increased performance, and added numerous extensions to the distribution (including an extension that mimics PHP Markdown Extra), all while maintaining backward compatibility with the end user API in version 1.7. Python-Markdown supports Python versions 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6. We have even released a version converted to Python 3.0! Backwards-incompatible Changes \u00b6 While Python-Markdown has experienced numerous internal changes, those changes should only affect extension authors. If you have not written your own extensions, then you should not need to make any changes to your code. However, you may want to ensure that any third party extensions you are using are compatible with the new API. The new extension API is fully documented in the docs. Below is a summary of the significant changes: The old home-grown NanoDOM has been replaced with ElementTree. Therefore all extensions must use ElementTree rather than the old NanoDOM. The various processors and patterns are now stored with OrderedDicts rather than lists. Any code adding processors and/or patterns into Python-Markdown will need to be adjusted to use the new API using OrderedDicts. The various types of processors available have been either combined, added, or removed. Ensure that your processors match the currently supported types. What\u2019s New in Python-Markdown 2.0 \u00b6 Thanks to the work of Artem Yunusov as part of GSoC 2008, Python-Markdown uses ElementTree internally to build the (X)HTML document from markdown source text. This has resolved various issues with the older home-grown NanoDOM and made notable increases in performance. Artem also refactored the Inline Patterns to better support nested patterns which has resolved many inconsistencies in Python-Markdown\u2019s parsing of the markdown syntax. The core parser had been completely rewritten, increasing performance and, for the first time, making it possible to override/add/change the way block level content is parsed. Python-Markdown now parses markdown source text more closely to the other popular implementations (Perl, PHP, etc.) than it ever has before. With the exception of a few minor insignificant differences, any difference should be considered a bug, rather than a limitation of the parser. The option to return HTML4 output as apposed to XHTML has been added. In addition, extensions should be able to easily add additional output formats. As part of implementing markdown in the Dr. Project project (a Trac fork), among other things, David Wolever refactored the \u201cextension\u201d keyword so that it accepts either the extension names as strings or instances of extensions.

In fact, we consider 2.1 to be what 2.0 should have been. While 2.1 consists mostly of bug fixes, bringing Python-Markdown more inline with other implementations, some internal improvements were made to the parser, a few new built-in extensions were added, and HTML5 support was added. Python-Markdown supports Python versions 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, and 3.2 out of the box. In fact, the same code base installs on Python 3.1 and 3.2 with no extra work by the end user. Backwards-incompatible Changes \u00b6 While Python-Markdown has received only minor internal changes since the last release, there are a few backward-incompatible changes to note: Support had been dropped for Python 2.3. No guarantees are made that the library will work in any version of Python lower than 2.4. Additionally, while the library had been tested with Python 2.4, consider Python 2.4 support to be depreciated. It is not likely that any future versions will continue to support any version of Python less than 2.5. Note that Python 3.0 is not supported due to a bug in its 2to3 tool. If you must use Python-Markdown with Python 3.0, it is suggested you manually use Python 3.1\u2019s 2to3 tool to do a conversion. Python-Markdown previously accepted positional arguments on its class and wrapper methods. It now expects keyword arguments. Currently, the positional arguments should continue to work, but the solution feels hacky and may be removed in a future version. All users are encouraged to use keyword arguments as documented in the Library Reference . Past versions of Python-Markdown provided module level Global variables which controlled the behavior of a few different aspects of the parser. Those global variables have been replaced with attributes on the Markdown class. Additionally, those attributes are settable as keyword arguments when initializing a class instance. Therefore, if you were editing the global variables (either by editing the source or by overriding them in your code), you should now set them on the class. See the Library Reference for the options available. If you have been using the HeaderId extension to define custom ids on headers, you will want to switch to using the new Attribute List extension. The HeaderId extension now only auto-generates ids on headers which have not already had ids defined. Note that the Extra extension has been switched to use Attribute Lists instead of HeaderId as it did previously. Some code was moved into the markdown.util namespace which was previously in the markdown namespace. Extension authors may need to adjust a few import statements in their extensions to work with the changes. The command line script name was changed to markdown_py . The previous name ( markdown ) was conflicting with people (and Linux package systems) who also had markdown.pl installed on there system as markdown.pl\u2019s command line script was also named markdown . Be aware that installing Python-Markdown 2.1 will not remove the old versions of the script with different names. You may want to remove them yourself as they are unlikely to work properly. What\u2019s New in Python-Markdown 2.1 \u00b6 Three new extensions were added. Attribute Lists , which was inspired by Maruku\u2019s feature of the same name, Newline to Break , which was inspired by GitHub Flavored Markdown, and Smart Strong, which fills a hole in the Extra extension. HTML5 is now supported. All this really means is that new block level elements introduced in the HTML5 spec are now properly recognized as raw HTML. As valid HTML5 can consist of either HTML4 or XHTML1, there is no need to add a new HTML5 serializers. That said, html5 and xhtml5 have been added as aliases of the html4 and xhtml1 serializers respectively. An XHTML serializer has been added. Previously, ElementTree\u2019s XML serializer was being used for XHTML output. With the new serializer we are able to avoid more invalid output like empty elements (i.e., <p /> ) which can choke browsers. Improved support for Python 3.x. Now when running setupy.py install in Python 3.1 or greater the 2to3 tool is run automatically. Note that Python 3.0 is not supported due to a bug in its 2to3 tool. If you must use Python-Markdown with Python 3.0, it is suggested you manually use Python 3.1\u2019s 2to3 tool to do a conversion. Methods on instances of the Markdown class that do not return results can now be changed allowing one to do md.reset().convert(moretext) . The Markdown class was refactored so that a subclass could define its own build_parser method which would build a completely different parser. In other words, one could use the basic machinery in the markdown library to build a parser of a different markup language without the overhead of building the markdown parser and throwing it away. Import statements within markdown have been improved so that third party libraries can embed the markdown library if they desire (licensing permitting). Added support for Python\u2019s -m command line option. You can run the markdown package as a command line script. Do python -m markdown [options] [args] . Note that this is only fully supported in Python 2.7+. Python 2.5 & 2.6 require you to call the module directly ( markdown.__main__ ) rather than the package ( markdown ). This does not work in Python 2.4. The command line script has been renamed to markdown_py which avoids all the various problems we had with previous names. Also improved the command line script to accept input on stdin . The testing framework has been completely rebuilt using the Nose testing framework. This provides a number of benefits including the ability to better test the built-in extensions and other options available to change the parsing behavior. See the Test Suite documentation for details. Various bug fixes have been made, which are too numerous to list here. See the commit log for a complete history of the changes.","title":"Release Notes for v.2.1"},{"location":"change_log/release-2.1/#python-markdown-21-release-notes","text":"We are pleased to release Python-Markdown 2.1 which makes many improvements on 2.0.

It is not likely that any future versions will continue to support any version of Python less than 2.5. Note that Python 3.0 is not supported due to a bug in its 2to3 tool. If you must use Python-Markdown with Python 3.0, it is suggested you manually use Python 3.1\u2019s 2to3 tool to do a conversion. Python-Markdown previously accepted positional arguments on its class and wrapper methods. It now expects keyword arguments. Currently, the positional arguments should continue to work, but the solution feels hacky and may be removed in a future version. All users are encouraged to use keyword arguments as documented in the Library Reference . Past versions of Python-Markdown provided module level Global variables which controlled the behavior of a few different aspects of the parser. Those global variables have been replaced with attributes on the Markdown class. Additionally, those attributes are settable as keyword arguments when initializing a class instance. Therefore, if you were editing the global variables (either by editing the source or by overriding them in your code), you should now set them on the class. See the Library Reference for the options available. If you have been using the HeaderId extension to define custom ids on headers, you will want to switch to using the new Attribute List extension. The HeaderId extension now only auto-generates ids on headers which have not already had ids defined. Note that the Extra extension has been switched to use Attribute Lists instead of HeaderId as it did previously. Some code was moved into the markdown.util namespace which was previously in the markdown namespace. Extension authors may need to adjust a few import statements in their extensions to work with the changes. The command line script name was changed to markdown_py . The previous name ( markdown ) was conflicting with people (and Linux package systems) who also had markdown.pl installed on there system as markdown.pl\u2019s command line script was also named markdown . Be aware that installing Python-Markdown 2.1 will not remove the old versions of the script with different names. You may want to remove them yourself as they are unlikely to work properly.","title":"Backwards-incompatible Changes"},{"location":"change_log/release-2.1/#whats-new-in-python-markdown-21","text":"Three new extensions were added. Attribute Lists , which was inspired by Maruku\u2019s feature of the same name, Newline to Break , which was inspired by GitHub Flavored Markdown, and Smart Strong, which fills a hole in the Extra extension. HTML5 is now supported. All this really means is that new block level elements introduced in the HTML5 spec are now properly recognized as raw HTML. As valid HTML5 can consist of either HTML4 or XHTML1, there is no need to add a new HTML5 serializers. That said, html5 and xhtml5 have been added as aliases of the html4 and xhtml1 serializers respectively. An XHTML serializer has been added. Previously, ElementTree\u2019s XML serializer was being used for XHTML output. With the new serializer we are able to avoid more invalid output like empty elements (i.e., <p /> ) which can choke browsers. Improved support for Python 3.x. Now when running setupy.py install in Python 3.1 or greater the 2to3 tool is run automatically. Note that Python 3.0 is not supported due to a bug in its 2to3 tool. If you must use Python-Markdown with Python 3.0, it is suggested you manually use Python 3.1\u2019s 2to3 tool to do a conversion. Methods on instances of the Markdown class that do not return results can now be changed allowing one to do md.reset().convert(moretext) . The Markdown class was refactored so that a subclass could define its own build_parser method which would build a completely different parser. In other words, one could use the basic machinery in the markdown library to build a parser of a different markup language without the overhead of building the markdown parser and throwing it away. Import statements within markdown have been improved so that third party libraries can embed the markdown library if they desire (licensing permitting). Added support for Python\u2019s -m command line option. You can run the markdown package as a command line script. Do python -m markdown [options] [args] . Note that this is only fully supported in Python 2.7+. Python 2.5 & 2.6 require you to call the module directly ( markdown.__main__ ) rather than the package ( markdown ). This does not work in Python 2.4. The command line script has been renamed to markdown_py which avoids all the various problems we had with previous names. Also improved the command line script to accept input on stdin . The testing framework has been completely rebuilt using the Nose testing framework. This provides a number of benefits including the ability to better test the built-in extensions and other options available to change the parsing behavior. See the Test Suite documentation for details. Various bug fixes have been made, which are too numerous to list here.

See the list of changes below for details. Python-Markdown version 2.5 supports Python versions 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4. Backwards-incompatible Changes \u00b6 Python-Markdown no longer supports Python version 2.6. You must be using Python versions 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, or 3.4. The force_linenos configuration key on the CodeHilite Extension has been deprecated and will raise a KeyError if provided. In the previous release (2.4), it was issuing a DeprecationWarning . The linenums keyword should be used instead, which provides more control of the output. Both safe_mode and the associated html_replacement_text keywords will be deprecated in version 2.6 and will raise a PendingDeprecationWarning in 2.5. The so-called \u201csafe mode\u201d was never actually \u201csafe\u201d which has resulted in many people having a false sense of security when using it. As an alternative, the developers of Python-Markdown recommend that any untrusted content be passed through an HTML sanitizer (like Bleach ) after being converted to HTML by markdown. If your code previously looked like this: html = markdown . markdown ( text , same_mode = True ) Then it is recommended that you change your code to read something like this: import bleach html = bleach . clean ( markdown . markdown ( text )) If you are not interested in sanitizing untrusted text, but simply desire to escape raw HTML, then that can be accomplished through an extension which removes HTML parsing: from markdown.extensions import Extension class EscapeHtml ( Extension ): def extendMarkdown ( self , md , md_globals ): del md . preprocessors [ 'html_block' ] del md . inlinePatterns [ 'html' ] html = markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ EscapeHtml ()]) As the HTML would not be parsed with the above Extension, then the serializer will escape the raw HTML, which is exactly what happens now when safe_mode=\"escape\" . Positional arguments on the markdown.Markdown() are pending deprecation as are all except the text argument on the markdown.markdown() wrapper function. Only keyword arguments should be used. For example, if your code previously looked like this: html = markdown . markdown ( text , [ 'extra' ]) Then it is recommended that you change it to read something like this: html = markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ 'extra' ]) Note This change is being made as a result of deprecating \"safe_mode\" as the safe_mode argument was one of the positional arguments. When that argument is removed, the two arguments following it will no longer be at the correct position. It is recommended that you always use keywords when they are supported for this reason. In previous versions of Python-Markdown, the built-in extensions received special status and did not require the full path to be provided. Additionally, third party extensions whose name started with \"mdx_\" received the same special treatment. This behavior will be deprecated in version 2.6 and will raise a PendingDeprecationWarning in 2.5. Ensure that you always use the full path to your extensions. For example, if you previously did the following: markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ 'extra' ]) You should change your code to the following: markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ 'markdown.extensions.extra' ]) The same applies to the command line: $ python -m markdown -x markdown.extensions.extra input.txt See the documentation for a full explanation of the current behavior. The previously documented method of appending the extension configuration as a string to the extension name will be deprecated in Python-Markdown version 2.6 and will raise a PendingDeprecationWarning in 2.5. The extension_configs keyword should be used instead. See the documentation for a full explanation of the current behavior. What\u2019s New in Python-Markdown 2.5 \u00b6 The Smarty Extension has had a number of additional configuration settings added, which allows one to define their own substitutions to better support languages other than English. Thanks to Martin Altmayer for implementing this feature. Named Extensions (strings passed to the extensions keyword of markdown.Markdown ) can now point to any module and/or Class on your PYTHONPATH. While dot notation was previously supported, a module could not be at the root of your PYTHONPATH. The name had to contain at least one dot (requiring it to be a sub-module). This restriction no longer exists. Additionally, a Class may be specified in the name. The class must be at the end of the name (which uses dot notation from PYTHONPATH) and be separated by a colon from the module. Therefore, if you were to import the class like this: from path.to.module import SomeExtensionClass Then the named extension would comprise this string: \"path.to.module:SomeExtensionClass\" This allows multiple extensions to be implemented within the same module and still accessible when the user is not able to import the extension directly (perhaps from a template filter or the command line). This also means that extension modules are no longer required to include the makeExtension function which returns an instance of the extension class. However, if the user does not specify the class name (she only provides \"path.to.module\" ) the extension will fail to load without the makeExtension function included in the module. Extension authors will want to document carefully what is required to load their extensions. The Extension Configuration code has been refactored to make it a little easier for extension authors to work with configuration settings. As a result, the extension_configs keyword now accepts a dictionary rather than requiring a list of tuples. A list of tuples is still supported so no one needs to change their existing code. This should also simplify the learning curve for new users. Extension authors are encouraged to review the new methods available on the markdown.extnesions.Extension class for handling configuration and adjust their code going forward. The included extensions provide a model for best practices. See the API documentation for a full explanation. The Command Line Interface now accepts a --extensions_config (or -c ) option which accepts a file name and passes the parsed content of a YAML or JSON file to the extension_configs keyword of the markdown.Markdown class. The contents of the YAML or JSON must map to a Python Dictionary which matches the format required by the extension_configs keyword. Note that PyYAML is required to parse YAML files. The Admonition Extension is no longer considered \u201cexperimental.\u201d There have been various refactors of the testing framework. While those changes will not directly effect end users, the code is being better tested which will benefit everyone. Various bug fixes have been made.

If your code previously looked like this: html = markdown . markdown ( text , same_mode = True ) Then it is recommended that you change your code to read something like this: import bleach html = bleach . clean ( markdown . markdown ( text )) If you are not interested in sanitizing untrusted text, but simply desire to escape raw HTML, then that can be accomplished through an extension which removes HTML parsing: from markdown.extensions import Extension class EscapeHtml ( Extension ): def extendMarkdown ( self , md , md_globals ): del md . preprocessors [ 'html_block' ] del md . inlinePatterns [ 'html' ] html = markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ EscapeHtml ()]) As the HTML would not be parsed with the above Extension, then the serializer will escape the raw HTML, which is exactly what happens now when safe_mode=\"escape\" . Positional arguments on the markdown.Markdown() are pending deprecation as are all except the text argument on the markdown.markdown() wrapper function. Only keyword arguments should be used. For example, if your code previously looked like this: html = markdown . markdown ( text , [ 'extra' ]) Then it is recommended that you change it to read something like this: html = markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ 'extra' ]) Note This change is being made as a result of deprecating \"safe_mode\" as the safe_mode argument was one of the positional arguments. When that argument is removed, the two arguments following it will no longer be at the correct position. It is recommended that you always use keywords when they are supported for this reason. In previous versions of Python-Markdown, the built-in extensions received special status and did not require the full path to be provided. Additionally, third party extensions whose name started with \"mdx_\" received the same special treatment. This behavior will be deprecated in version 2.6 and will raise a PendingDeprecationWarning in 2.5. Ensure that you always use the full path to your extensions. For example, if you previously did the following: markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ 'extra' ]) You should change your code to the following: markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ 'markdown.extensions.extra' ]) The same applies to the command line: $ python -m markdown -x markdown.extensions.extra input.txt See the documentation for a full explanation of the current behavior. The previously documented method of appending the extension configuration as a string to the extension name will be deprecated in Python-Markdown version 2.6 and will raise a PendingDeprecationWarning in 2.5. The extension_configs keyword should be used instead. See the documentation for a full explanation of the current behavior.","title":"Backwards-incompatible Changes"},{"location":"change_log/release-2.5/#whats-new-in-python-markdown-25","text":"The Smarty Extension has had a number of additional configuration settings added, which allows one to define their own substitutions to better support languages other than English. Thanks to Martin Altmayer for implementing this feature. Named Extensions (strings passed to the extensions keyword of markdown.Markdown ) can now point to any module and/or Class on your PYTHONPATH. While dot notation was previously supported, a module could not be at the root of your PYTHONPATH. The name had to contain at least one dot (requiring it to be a sub-module). This restriction no longer exists. Additionally, a Class may be specified in the name. The class must be at the end of the name (which uses dot notation from PYTHONPATH) and be separated by a colon from the module. Therefore, if you were to import the class like this: from path.to.module import SomeExtensionClass Then the named extension would comprise this string: \"path.to.module:SomeExtensionClass\" This allows multiple extensions to be implemented within the same module and still accessible when the user is not able to import the extension directly (perhaps from a template filter or the command line). This also means that extension modules are no longer required to include the makeExtension function which returns an instance of the extension class. However, if the user does not specify the class name (she only provides \"path.to.module\" ) the extension will fail to load without the makeExtension function included in the module. Extension authors will want to document carefully what is required to load their extensions. The Extension Configuration code has been refactored to make it a little easier for extension authors to work with configuration settings. As a result, the extension_configs keyword now accepts a dictionary rather than requiring a list of tuples. A list of tuples is still supported so no one needs to change their existing code. This should also simplify the learning curve for new users. Extension authors are encouraged to review the new methods available on the markdown.extnesions.Extension class for handling configuration and adjust their code going forward. The included extensions provide a model for best practices. See the API documentation for a full explanation. The Command Line Interface now accepts a --extensions_config (or -c ) option which accepts a file name and passes the parsed content of a YAML or JSON file to the extension_configs keyword of the markdown.Markdown class. The contents of the YAML or JSON must map to a Python Dictionary which matches the format required by the extension_configs keyword. Note that PyYAML is required to parse YAML files. The Admonition Extension is no longer considered \u201cexperimental.\u201d There have been various refactors of the testing framework. While those changes will not directly effect end users, the code is being better tested which will benefit everyone. Various bug fixes have been made. See the commit log for a complete history of the changes.","title":"What's New in Python-Markdown 2.5"},{"location":"change_log/release-2.6/","text":"Python-Markdown 2.6 Release Notes \u00b6 We are pleased to release Python-Markdown 2.6 which adds a few new features and fixes various bugs. See the list of changes below for details. Python-Markdown version 2.6 supports Python versions 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 as well as PyPy. Backwards-incompatible Changes \u00b6 safe_mode Deprecated \u00b6 Both safe_mode and the associated html_replacement_text keywords are deprecated in version 2.6 and will raise a DeprecationWarning . The safe_mode and html_replacement_text keywords will be ignored in the next release. The so-called \u201csafe mode\u201d was never actually \u201csafe\u201d which has resulted in many people having a false sense of security when using it. As an alternative, the developers of Python-Markdown recommend that any untrusted content be passed through an HTML sanitizer (like Bleach ) after being converted to HTML by markdown. In fact, Bleach Whitelist provides a curated list of tags, attributes, and styles suitable for filtering user-provided HTML using bleach. If your code previously looked like this: html = markdown . markdown ( text , safe_mode = True ) Then it is recommended that you change your code to read something like this: import bleach from bleach_whitelist import markdown_tags , markdown_attrs html = bleach . clean ( markdown . markdown ( text ), markdown_tags , markdown_attrs ) If you are not interested in sanitizing untrusted text, but simply desire to escape raw HTML, then that can be accomplished through an extension which removes HTML parsing: from markdown.extensions import Extension class EscapeHtml ( Extension ): def extendMarkdown ( self , md , md_globals ): del md . preprocessors [ 'html_block' ] del md . inlinePatterns [ 'html' ] html = markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ EscapeHtml ()]) As the HTML would not be parsed with the above Extension, then the serializer will escape the raw HTML, which is exactly what happens now when safe_mode=\"escape\" . Positional Arguments Deprecated \u00b6 Positional arguments on the markdown.Markdown() class are deprecated as are all except the text argument on the markdown.markdown() wrapper function. Using positional arguments will raise a DeprecationWarning in 2.6 and an error in the next release. Only keyword arguments should be used. For example, if your code previously looked like this: html = markdown . markdown ( text , [ SomeExtension ()]) Then it is recommended that you change it to read something like this: html = markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ SomeExtension ()]) Note This change is being made as a result of deprecating \"safe_mode\" as the safe_mode argument was one of the positional arguments. When that argument is removed, the two arguments following it will no longer be at the correct position. It is recommended that you always use keywords when they are supported for this reason. \u201cShortened\u201d Extension Names Deprecated \u00b6 In previous versions of Python-Markdown, the built-in extensions received special status and did not require the full path to be provided. Additionally, third party extensions whose name started with \"mdx_\" received the same special treatment. This behavior is deprecated and will raise a DeprecationWarning in version 2.6 and an error in the next release. Ensure that you always use the full path to your extensions. For example, if you previously did the following: markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ 'extra' ]) You should change your code to the following: markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ 'markdown.extensions.extra' ]) The same applies to the command line: python - m markdown - x markdown . extensions . extra input . txt Similarly, if you have used a third party extension (for example mdx_math ), previously you might have called it like this: markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ 'math' ]) As the \"mdx\" prefix will no longer be appended, you will need to change your code as follows (assuming the file mdx_math.py is installed at the root of your PYTHONPATH): markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ 'mdx_math' ]) Extension authors will want to update their documentation to reflect the new behavior. See the documentation for a full explanation of the current behavior. Extension Configuration as Part of Extension Name Deprecated \u00b6 The previously documented method of appending the extension configuration options as a string to the extension name is deprecated and will raise a DeprecationWarning in version 2.6 and an error in 2.7. The extension_configs keyword should be used instead. See the documentation for a full explanation of the current behavior. HeaderId Extension Pending Deprecation \u00b6 The HeaderId Extension is pending deprecation and will raise a PendingDeprecationWarning in version 2.6. The extension will be deprecated in the next release and raise an error in the release after that. Use the Table of Contents Extension instead, which offers most of the features of the HeaderId Extension and more (support for meta data is missing). Extension authors who have been using the slugify and unique functions defined in the HeaderId Extension should note that those functions are now defined in the Table of Contents extension and should adjust their import statements accordingly ( from markdown.extensions.toc import slugify, unique ). The configs Keyword is Deprecated \u00b6 Positional arguments and the configs keyword on the markdown.extension.Extension class (and its subclasses) are deprecated. Each individual configuration option should be passed to the class as a keyword/value pair. For example. one might have previously initiated an extension subclass like this: ext = SomeExtension ( configs = { 'somekey' : 'somevalue' }) That code should be updated to pass in the options directly: ext = SomeExtension ( somekey = 'somevalue' ) Extension authors will want to note that this affects the makeExtension function as well. Previously it was common for the function to be defined as follows: def makeExtension ( configs = None ): return SomeExtension ( configs = configs ) Extension authors will want to update their code to the following instead: def makeExtension ( ** kwargs ): return SomeExtension ( ** kwargs ) Failing to do so will result in a DeprecationWarning and will raise an error in the next release. See the Extension API documentation for more information. In the event that an markdown.extension.Extension subclass overrides the __init__ method and implements its own configuration handling, then the above may not apply. However, it is recommended that the subclass still calls the parent __init__ method to handle configuration options like so: class SomeExtension ( markdown . extension . Extension ): def __init__ ( ** kwargs ): # Do pre-config stuff here # Set config defaults self . config = { 'option1' : [ 'value1' , 'description1' ], 'option2' : [ 'value2' , 'description2' ] } # Set user defined configs super ( MyExtension , self ) . __init__ ( ** kwargs ) # Do post-config stuff here Note the call to super to get the benefits of configuration handling from the parent class. See the documentation for more information. What\u2019s New in Python-Markdown 2.6 \u00b6 Official Support for PyPy \u00b6 Official support for PyPy has been added. While Python-Markdown has most likely worked on PyPy for some time, it is now officially supported and tested on PyPy. YAML Style Meta-Data \u00b6 The Meta-Data Extension now includes optional support for YAML style meta-data. By default, the YAML deliminators are recognized, however, the actual data is parsed as previously. This follows the syntax of MultiMarkdown , which inspired this extension. Alternatively, if the yaml option is set, then the data is parsed as YAML. As the yaml option was buggy, it was removed in 2.6.1. It is suggested that a preprocessor (like docdata ) or a third party extension be used if you want true YAML support. See Issue #390 for a full explanation. Table of Contents Extension Refactored \u00b6 The Table of Contents Extension has been refactored and some new features have been added. See the documentation for a full explanation of each feature listed below: The extension now assigns the Table of Contents to the toc attribute of the Markdown class regardless of whether a \u201cmarker\u201d was found in the document. Third party frameworks no longer need to insert a \u201cmarker,\u201d run the document through Markdown, then extract the Table of Contents from the document. The Table of Contents Extension is now a \u201cregistered extension.\u201d Therefore, when the reset method of the Markdown class is called, the toc attribute on the Markdown class is cleared (set to an empty string). When the marker configuration option is set to an empty string, the parser completely skips the process of searching the document for markers. This should save parsing time when the Table of Contents Extension is being used only to assign ids to headers. A separator configuration option has been added allowing users to override the separator character used by the slugify function. A baselevel configuration option has been added allowing users to set the base level of headers in their documents (h1-h6). This allows the header levels to be automatically adjusted to fit within the hierarchy of an HTML template. Pygments can now be disabled \u00b6 The CodeHilite Extension has gained a new configuration option: use_pygments . The option is True by default, however, it allows one to turn off Pygments code highlighting (set to False ) while preserving the language detection features of the extension. Note that Pygments language guessing is not used as that would \u2018use Pygments\u2019. If a language is defined for a code block, it will be assigned to the <code> tag as a class in the manner suggested by the HTML5 spec (alternate output will not be entertained) and could potentially be used by a JavaScript library in the browser to highlight the code block. Miscellaneous \u00b6 Test coverage has been improved including running flake8 . While those changes will not directly effect end users, the code is being better tested which will benefit everyone. Various bug fixes have been made.

Backwards-incompatible changes \u00b6 enable_attributes keyword deprecated \u00b6 The enable_attributes keyword is deprecated in version 3.0 and will be ignored. Previously the keyword was True by default and enabled an undocumented way to define attributes on document elements. The feature has been removed from version 3.0. As most users did not use the undocumented feature, it should not affect most users. For the few who did use the feature, it can be enabled by using the Legacy Attributes extension. smart_emphasis keyword and smart_strong extension deprecated \u00b6 The smart_emphasis keyword is deprecated in version 3.0 and will be ignored. Previously the keyword was True by default and caused the parser to ignore middle-word emphasis. Additionally, the optional smart_strong extension provided the same behavior for strong emphasis. Both of those features are now part of the default behavior, and the Legacy Emphasis extension is available to disable that behavior. output_formats simplified to html and xhtml . \u00b6 The output_formats keyword now only accepts two options: html and xhtml Note that if (x)html1 , (x)html4 or (x)html5 are passed in, the number is stripped and ignored. safe_mode and html_replacement_text keywords deprecated \u00b6 Both safe_mode and the associated html_replacement_text keywords are deprecated in version 3.0 and will be ignored.

Positional arguments deprecated \u00b6 Positional arguments on the markdown.Markdown() class are deprecated as are all except the text argument on the markdown.markdown() wrapper function. Using positional arguments will raise an error. Only keyword arguments should be used. For example, if your code previously looked like this: html = markdown . markdown ( text , [ SomeExtension ()]) Then it is recommended that you change it to read something like this: html = markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ SomeExtension ()]) Note This change is being made as a result of deprecating \"safe_mode\" as the safe_mode argument was one of the positional arguments. When that argument is removed, the two arguments following it will no longer be at the correct position. It is recommended that you always use keywords when they are supported for this reason. Extension name behavior has changed \u00b6 In previous versions of Python-Markdown, the built-in extensions received special status and did not require the full path to be provided. Additionally, third party extensions whose name started with \"mdx_\" received the same special treatment. This is no longer the case. Support has been added for extensions to define an entry point . An entry point is a string name which can be used to point to an Extension class. The built-in extensions now have entry points which match the old short names. And any third-party extensions which define entry points can now get the same behavior. See the documentation for each specific extension to find the assigned name. If an extension does not define an entry point, then the full path to the extension must be used. See the documentation for a full explanation of the current behavior. Extension configuration as part of extension name deprecated \u00b6 The previously documented method of appending the extension configuration options as a string to the extension name is deprecated and will raise an error. The extension_configs keyword should be used instead. See the documentation for a full explanation of the current behavior. HeaderId extension deprecated \u00b6 The HeaderId Extension is deprecated and will raise an error if specified. Use the Table of Contents Extension instead, which offers most of the features of the HeaderId Extension and more (support for meta data is missing). Extension authors who have been using the slugify and unique functions defined in the HeaderId Extension should note that those functions are now defined in the Table of Contents extension and should adjust their import statements accordingly ( from markdown.extensions.toc import slugify, unique ). Homegrown OrderedDict has been replaced with a purpose-built Registry \u00b6 All processors and patterns now get \u201cregistered\u201d to a Registry . A backwards compatible shim is included so that existing simple extensions should continue to work. A DeprecationWarning will be raised for any code which calls the old API. Markdown class instance references. \u00b6 Previously, instances of the Markdown class were represented as any one of md , md_instance , or markdown . This inconsistency made it difficult when developing extensions, or just maintaining the existing code. Now, all instances are consistently represented as md . The old attributes on class instances still exist, but raise a DeprecationWarning when accessed. Also on classes where the instance was optional, the attribute always exists now and is simply None if no instance was provided (previously the attribute would not exist). markdown.util.isBlockLevel deprecated \u00b6 The markdown.util.isBlockLevel function is deprecated and will raise a DeprecationWarning . Instead, extensions should use the isBlockLevel method of the Markdown class instance. Additionally, a list of block level elements is defined in the block_level_elements attribute of the Markdown class which extensions can access to alter the list of elements which are treated as block level elements. md_globals keyword deprecated from extension API \u00b6 Previously, the extendMarkdown method of a markdown.extensions.Extension subclasses accepted an md_globals keyword, which contained the value returned by Python\u2019s globals() built-in function. As all of the configuration is now held within the Markdown class instance, access to the globals is no longer necessary and any extensions which expect the keyword will raise a DeprecationWarning . A future release will raise an error. markdown.version and markdown.version_info deprecated \u00b6 Historically, version numbers were acquired via the attributes markdown.version and markdown.version_info . Moving forward, a more standardized approach is being followed and versions are acquired via the markdown.__version__ and markdown.__version_info__ attributes. The legacy attributes are still available to allow distinguishing versions between the legacy Markdown 2.0 series and the Markdown 3.0 series, but in the future the legacy attributes will be removed. Added new, more flexible InlineProcessor class \u00b6 A new InlineProcessor class handles inline processing much better and allows for more flexibility. The new InlineProcessor classes no longer utilize unnecessary pretext and post-text captures. New class can accept the buffer that is being worked on and manually process the text without regular expressions and return new replacement bounds. This helps us to handle links in a better way and handle nested brackets and logic that is too much for regular expression. New features \u00b6 The following new features have been included in the release: A new testing framework is included as a part of the Markdown library, which can also be used by third party extensions. A new toc_depth parameter has been added to the Table of Contents Extension . A new toc_tokens attribute has been added to the Markdown class by the Table of Contents Extension , which contains the raw tokens used to build the Table of Contents. Users can use this to build their own custom Table of Contents rather than needing to parse the HTML available on the toc attribute of the Markdown class. When the Table of Contents Extension is used in conjunction with the Attribute Lists Extension and a data-toc-label attribute is defined on a header, the content of the data-toc-label attribute is now used as the content of the Table of Contents item for that header.

The so-called \u201csafe mode\u201d was never actually \u201csafe\u201d which has resulted in many people having a false sense of security when using it. As an alternative, the developers of Python-Markdown recommend that any untrusted content be passed through an HTML sanitizer (like Bleach ) after being converted to HTML by markdown. In fact, Bleach Whitelist provides a curated list of tags, attributes, and styles suitable for filtering user-provided HTML using bleach. If your code previously looked like this: html = markdown . markdown ( text , safe_mode = True ) Then it is recommended that you change your code to read something like this: import bleach from bleach_whitelist import markdown_tags , markdown_attrs html = bleach . clean ( markdown . markdown ( text ), markdown_tags , markdown_attrs ) If you are not interested in sanitizing untrusted text, but simply desire to escape raw HTML, then that can be accomplished through an extension which removes HTML parsing: from markdown.extensions import Extension class EscapeHtml ( Extension ): def extendMarkdown ( self , md ): md . preprocessors . deregister ( 'html_block' ) md . inlinePatterns . deregister ( 'html' ) html = markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ EscapeHtml ()]) As the HTML would not be parsed with the above Extension, then the serializer will escape the raw HTML, which is exactly what happened in previous versions with safe_mode=\"escape\" .","title":"safe_mode and html_replacement_text keywords deprecated"},{"location":"change_log/release-3.0/#positional-arguments-deprecated","text":"Positional arguments on the markdown.Markdown() class are deprecated as are all except the text argument on the markdown.markdown() wrapper function.

Backwards-incompatible changes \u00b6 The prefix language- is now prepended to all language classes by default on code blocks. \u00b6 The HTML5 spec recommends that the class defining the language of a code block be prefixed with language- . Therefore, by default, both the fenced_code and codehilite extensions now prepend the prefix when code highlighting is disabled. If you have previously been including the prefix manually in your fenced code blocks, then you will not want a second instance of the prefix. Similarly, if you are using a third party syntax highlighting tool which does not recognize the prefix, or requires a different prefix, then you will want to redefine the prefix globally using the lang_prefix configuration option of either the fenced_code or codehilite extensions. For example, to configure fenced_code to not apply any prefix (the previous behavior), set the option to an empty string: from markdown.extensions.fenced_code import FencedCodeExtension markdown . markdown ( src , extensions = [ FencedCodeExtension ( lang_prefix = '' )]) Note When code highlighting is enabled , the output from Pygments is used unaltered. Currently, Pygments does not provide an option to include the language class in the output, let alone prefix it. Therefore, any language prefix is only applied when syntax highlighting is disabled. Attribute Lists are more strict (#898). \u00b6 Empty curly braces are now completely ignored by the Attribute List extension. Previously, the extension would recognize them as attribute lists and remove them from the document. Therefore, it is no longer necessary to backslash escape a set of curly braces which are empty or only contain whitespace. Despite not being documented, previously an attribute list could be defined anywhere within a table cell and get applied to the cell ( <td> element). Now the attribute list must be defined at the end of the cell content and must be separated from the rest of the content by at least one space. This makes it easy to differentiate between attribute lists defined on inline elements within a cell and the attribute list for the cell itself. It is also more consistent with how attribute lists are defined on other types of elements. The extension has also added support for defining attribute lists on table header cells ( <th> elements) in the same manner as data cells ( <td> elements). In addition, the documentation for the extensions received an overhaul. The features (#987) and limitations (#965) of the extension are now fully documented. New features \u00b6 The following new features have been included in the 3.3 release: All Pygments\u2019 options are now available for syntax highlighting (#816). The Codehilite extension now accepts any options which Pygments supports as global configuration settings on the extension. Fenced Code Blocks will accept any of the same options on individual code blocks. Any of the previously supported aliases to Pygments\u2019 options continue to be supported at this time. However, it is recommended that the Pygments option names be used directly to ensure continued compatibility in the future. Fenced Code Blocks now work with Attribute Lists when syntax highlighting is disabled. Any random HTML attribute can be defined and set on the <code> tag of fenced code blocks when the attr_list extension is enabled (#816). The HTML parser has been completely replaced. The new HTML parser is built on Python\u2019s html.parser.HTMLParser , which alleviates various bugs and simplify maintenance of the code (#803, #830). The Markdown in HTML extension has been rebuilt on the new HTML Parser, which drastically simplifies it. Note that raw HTML elements with a markdown attribute defined are now converted to ElementTree Elements and are rendered by the serializer. Various bugs have been fixed (#803, #595, #780, and #1012). Link reference parsing, abbreviation reference parsing and footnote reference parsing has all been moved from preprocessors to blockprocessors , which allows them to be nested within other block level elements. Specifically, this change was necessary to maintain the current behavior in the rebuilt Markdown in HTML extension. A few random edge-case bugs (see the included tests) were resolved in the process (#803). An alternate function markdown.extensions.headerid.slugify_unicode has been included with the Table of Contents extension which supports Unicode characters in table of contents slugs. The old markdown.extensions.headerid.slugify method which removes non-ASCII characters remains the default. Import and pass markdown.extensions.headerid.slugify_unicode to the slugify configuration option to use the new behavior. Support was added for Python 3.9 and dropped for Python 3.5.

Link reference parsing, abbreviation reference parsing and footnote reference parsing has all been moved from preprocessors to blockprocessors , which allows them to be nested within other block level elements. Specifically, this change was necessary to maintain the current behavior in the rebuilt Markdown in HTML extension. A few random edge-case bugs (see the included tests) were resolved in the process (#803). An alternate function markdown.extensions.headerid.slugify_unicode has been included with the Table of Contents extension which supports Unicode characters in table of contents slugs. The old markdown.extensions.headerid.slugify method which removes non-ASCII characters remains the default. Import and pass markdown.extensions.headerid.slugify_unicode to the slugify configuration option to use the new behavior. Support was added for Python 3.9 and dropped for Python 3.5.","title":"New features"},{"location":"change_log/release-3.3/#bug-fixes","text":"The following bug fixes are included in the 3.3 release: Document how to pass configuration options to Extra (#1019).

An extension will patch into one or more stages of the parser: Preprocessors alter the source before it is passed to the parser. Block Processors work with blocks of text separated by blank lines. Tree Processors modify the constructed ElementTree Inline Processors are common tree processors for inline elements, such as *strong* . Postprocessors munge of the output of the parser just before it is returned. The parser loads text, applies the preprocessors, creates and builds an ElementTree object from the block processors and inline processors, renders the ElementTree object as Unicode text, and then then applies the postprocessors. There are classes and helpers provided to ease writing your extension. Each part of the API is discussed in its respective section below. Additionally, you can walk through the Tutorial on Writing Extensions ; look at some of the Available Extensions and their source code . As always, you may report bugs, ask for help, and discuss various other issues on the bug tracker . Phases of processing \u00b6 Preprocessors \u00b6 Preprocessors munge the source text before it is passed to the Markdown parser. This is an excellent place to clean up bad characters or to extract portions for later processing that the parser may otherwise choke on. Preprocessors inherit from markdown.preprocessors.Preprocessor and implement a run method, which takes a single parameter lines . This parameter is the entire source text stored as a list of Unicode strings, one per line. run should return its processed list of Unicode strings, one per line. Example \u00b6 This simple example removes any lines with \u2018NO RENDER\u2019 before processing: from markdown.preprocessors import Preprocessor import re class NoRender ( Preprocessor ): \"\"\" Skip any line with words 'NO RENDER' in it. \"\"\" def run ( self , lines ): new_lines = [] for line in lines : m = re . search ( \"NO RENDER\" , line ) if not m : # any line without NO RENDER is passed through new_lines . append ( line ) return new_lines Usages \u00b6 Some preprocessors in the Markdown source tree include: Class Kind Description NormalizeWhiteSpace built-in Normalizes whitespace by expanding tabs, fixing \\r line endings, etc. HtmlBlockPreprocessor built-in Removes html blocks from the text and stores them for later processing ReferencePreprocessor built-in Removes reference definitions from text and stores for later processing MetaPreprocessor extension Strips and records meta data at top of documents FootnotesPreprocessor extension Removes footnote blocks from the text and stores them for later processing Block Processors \u00b6 A block processor parses blocks of text and adds new elements to the ElementTree . Blocks of text, separated from other text by blank lines, may have a different syntax and produce a differently structured tree than other Markdown. Block processors excel at code formatting, equation layouts, and tables. Block processors inherit from markdown.blockprocessors.BlockProcessor , are passed md.parser on initialization, and implement both the test and run methods: test(self, parent, block) takes two parameters: parent is the parent ElementTree element and block is a single, multi-line, Unicode string of the current block. test , often a regular expression match, returns a true value if the block processor\u2019s run method should be called to process starting at that block. run(self, parent, blocks) has the same parent parameter as test ; and blocks is the list of all remaining blocks in the document, starting with the block passed to test . run may return False (not None ) to signal failure, meaning that it did not process the blocks after all. On success, run is expected to pop one or more blocks from the front of blocks and attach new nodes to parent . Crafting block processors is more involved and flexible than the other processors, involving controlling recursive parsing of the block\u2019s contents and managing state across invocations. For example, a blank line is allowed in indented code, so the second invocation of the inline code processor appends to the element tree generated by the previous call. Other block processors may insert new text into the blocks list, signal to future calls of itself, and more. To make writing these complex beasts more tractable, three convenience functions have been provided by the BlockProcessor parent class: lastChild(parent) returns the last child of the given element or None if it has no children. detab(text) removes one level of indent (four spaces by default) from the front of each line of the given multi-line, text string, until a non-blank line is indented less. looseDetab(text, level) removes multiple levels of indent from the front of each line of text but does not affect lines indented less. Also, BlockProcessor provides the fields self.tab_length , the tab length (default 4), and self.parser , the current BlockParser instance. BlockParser \u00b6 BlockParser , not to be confused with BlockProcessor , is the class used by Markdown to cycle through all the registered block processors. You should never need to create your own instance; use self.parser instead. The BlockParser instance provides a stack of strings for its current state, which your processor can push with self.parser.set(state) , pop with self.parser.reset() , or check the the top state with self.parser.isstate(state) . Be sure your code pops the states it pushes. The BlockParser instance can also be called recursively, that is, to process blocks from within your block processor. There are three methods: parseDocument(lines) parses a list of lines, each a single-line Unicode string, returning a complete ElementTree . parseChunk(parent, text) parses a single, multi-line, possibly multi-block, Unicode string text and attaches the resulting tree to parent . parseBlocks(parent, blocks) takes a list of blocks , each a multi-line Unicode string without blank lines, and attaches the resulting tree to parent . For perspective, Markdown calls parseDocument which calls parseChunk which calls parseBlocks which calls your block processor, which, in turn, might call one of these routines. Example \u00b6 This example calls out important paragraphs by giving them a border. It looks for a fence line of exclamation points before and after and renders the fenced blocks into a new, styled div . If it does not find the ending fence line, it does nothing. Our code, like most block processors, is longer than other examples: def test_block_processor (): class BoxBlockProcessor ( BlockProcessor ): RE_FENCE_START = r '^ *!{3,} *\\n' # start line, e.g., ` !!!! ` RE_FENCE_END = r '\\n *!{3,}\\s*$' # last non-blank line, e.g, '!!!\\n \\n\\n' def test ( self , parent , block ): return re . match ( self . RE_FENCE_START , block ) def run ( self , parent , blocks ): original_block = blocks [ 0 ] blocks [ 0 ] = re . sub ( self . RE_FENCE_START , '' , blocks [ 0 ]) # Find block with ending fence for block_num , block in enumerate ( blocks ): if re . search ( self . RE_FENCE_END , block ): # remove fence blocks [ block_num ] = re . sub ( self . RE_FENCE_END , '' , block ) # render fenced area inside a new div e = etree . SubElement ( parent , 'div' ) e . set ( 'style' , 'display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;' ) self . parser . parseBlocks ( e , blocks [ 0 : block_num + 1 ]) # remove used blocks for i in range ( 0 , block_num + 1 ): blocks . pop ( 0 ) return True # or could have had no return statement # No closing marker! Restore and do nothing blocks [ 0 ] = original_block return False # equivalent to our test() routine returning False class BoxExtension ( Extension ): def extendMarkdown ( self , md ): md . parser . blockprocessors . register ( BoxBlockProcessor ( md . parser ), 'box' , 175 ) Start with this example input: A regular paragraph of text. !!!!! First paragraph of wrapped text. Second Paragraph of **wrapped** text. !!!!! Another regular paragraph of text. The fenced text adds one node with two children to the tree: div , with a style attribute. It renders as <div style=\"display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;\">...</div> p with text First paragraph of wrapped text. p with text Second Paragraph of **wrapped** text . The conversion to a <strong> tag will happen when running the inline processors, which will happen after all of the block processors have completed. The example output might display as follows: A regular paragraph of text. First paragraph of wrapped text. Second Paragraph of wrapped text. Another regular paragraph of text. Usages \u00b6 Some block processors in the Markdown source tree include: Class Kind Description HashHeaderProcessor built-in Title hashes ( # ), which may split blocks HRProcessor built-in Horizontal lines, e.g., --- OListProcessor built-in Ordered lists; complex and using state Admonition extension Render each Admonition in a new div Tree processors \u00b6 Tree processors manipulate the tree created by block processors. They can even create an entirely new ElementTree object. This is an excellent place for creating summaries, adding collected references, or last minute adjustments. A tree processor must inherit from markdown.treeprocessors.Treeprocessor (note the capitalization). A tree processor must implement a run method which takes a single argument root . In most cases root would be an xml.etree.ElementTree.Element instance; however, in rare cases it could be some other type of ElementTree object. The run method may return None , in which case the (possibly modified) original root object is used, or it may return an entirely new Element object, which will replace the existing root object and all of its children. It is generally preferred to modify root in place and return None , which avoids creating multiple copies of the entire document tree in memory. For specifics on manipulating the ElementTree, see Working with the ElementTree below. Example \u00b6 A pseudo example: from markdown.treeprocessors import Treeprocessor class MyTreeprocessor ( Treeprocessor ): def run ( self , root ): root . text = 'modified content' # No return statement is same as `return None` Usages \u00b6 The core InlineProcessor class is a tree processor. It walks the tree, matches patterns, and splits and creates nodes on matches. Additional tree processors in the Markdown source tree include: Class Kind Description PrettifyTreeprocessor built-in Add line breaks to the html document TocTreeprocessor extension Builds a table of contents from the finished tree FootnoteTreeprocessor extension Create footnote div at end of document FootnotePostTreeprocessor extension Amend div created by FootnoteTreeprocessor with duplicates Inline Processors \u00b6 Inline processors, previously called inline patterns, are used to add formatting, such as **emphasis** , by replacing a matched pattern with a new element tree node. It is an excellent for adding new syntax for inline tags. Inline processor code is often quite short. Inline processors inherit from InlineProcessor , are initialized, and implement handleMatch : __init__(self, pattern, md=None) is the inherited constructor. You do not need to implement your own. pattern is the regular expression string that must match the code block in order for the handleMatch method to be called. md , an optional parameter, is a pointer to the instance of markdown.Markdown and is available as self.md on the InlineProcessor instance. handleMatch(self, m, data) must be implemented in all InlineProcessor subclasses. m is the regular expression match object found by the pattern passed to __init__ . data is a single, multi-line, Unicode string containing the entire block of text around the pattern. A block is text set apart by blank lines. Returns either (None, None, None) , indicating the provided match was rejected or (el, start, end) , if the match was successfully processed. On success, el is the element being added the tree, start and end are indexes in data that were \u201cconsumed\u201d by the pattern. The \u201cconsumed\u201d span will be replaced by a placeholder. The same inline processor may be called several times on the same block. Inline Processors can define the property ANCESTOR_EXCLUDES which is either a list or tuple of undesirable ancestors. The processor will be skipped if it would cause the content to be a descendant of one of the listed tag names. Convenience Classes \u00b6 Convenience subclasses of InlineProcessor are provide for common operations: SimpleTextInlineProcessor returns the text of group(1) of the match. SubstituteTagInlineProcessor is initialized as SubstituteTagInlineProcessor(pattern, tag) . It returns a new element tag whenever pattern is matched. SimpleTagInlineProcessor is initialized as SimpleTagInlineProcessor(pattern, tag) . It returns an element tag with a text field of group(2) of the match. Example \u00b6 This example changes --strike-- to <del>strike</del> . from markdown.inlinepatterns import InlineProcessor from markdown.extensions import Extension import xml.etree.ElementTree as etree class DelInlineProcessor ( InlineProcessor ): def handleMatch ( self , m , data ): el = etree . Element ( 'del' ) el . text = m . group ( 1 ) return el , m . start ( 0 ), m . end ( 0 ) class DelExtension ( Extension ): def extendMarkdown ( self , md ): DEL_PATTERN = r '--(.*?)--' # like --del-- md . inlinePatterns . register ( DelInlineProcessor ( DEL_PATTERN , md ), 'del' , 175 ) Use this input example: First line of the block. This is --strike one--. This is --strike two--. End of the block. The example output might display as follows: First line of the block. This is strike one . This is strike two . End of the block. On the first call to handleMatch m will be the match for --strike one-- data will be the string: First line of the block.\\nThis is --strike one--.\\nThis is --strike two--.\\nEnd of the block. Because the match was successful, the region between the returned start and end are replaced with a placeholder token and the new element is added to the tree. On the second call to handleMatch m will be the match for --strike two-- data will be the string First line of the block.\\nThis is klzzwxh:0000.\\nThis is --strike two--.\\nEnd of the block. Note the placeholder token klzzwxh:0000 . This allows the regular expression to be run against the entire block, not just the the text contained in an individual element. The placeholders will later be swapped back out for the actual elements by the parser. Actually it would not be necessary to create the above inline processor. The fact is, that example is not very DRY (Don\u2019t Repeat Yourself). A pattern for **strong** text would be almost identical, with the exception that it would create a strong element. Therefore, Markdown provides a number of generic InlineProcessor subclasses that can provide some common functionality. For example, strike could be implemented with an instance of the SimpleTagInlineProcessor class as demonstrated below. Feel free to use or extend any of the InlineProcessor subclasses found at markdown.inlinepatterns . from markdown.inlinepatterns import SimpleTagInlineProcessor from markdown.extensions import Extension class DelExtension ( Extension ): def extendMarkdown ( self , md ): md . inlinePatterns . register ( SimpleTagInlineProcessor ( r '()--(.*?)--' , 'del' ), 'del' , 175 ) Usages \u00b6 Here are some convenience functions and other examples: Class Kind Description AsteriskProcessor built-in Emphasis processor for handling strong and em matches inside asterisks AbbrInlineProcessor extension Apply tag to abbreviation registered by preprocessor WikiLinksInlineProcessor extension Link [[article names]] to wiki given in metadata FootnoteInlineProcessor extension Replaces footnote in text with link to footnote div at bottom Patterns \u00b6 In version 3.0, a new, more flexible inline processor was added, markdown.inlinepatterns.InlineProcessor . The original inline patterns, which inherit from markdown.inlinepatterns.Pattern or one of its children are still supported, though users are encouraged to migrate. Comparison with new InlineProcessor \u00b6 The new InlineProcessor provides two major enhancements to Patterns : Inline Processors no longer need to match the entire block, so regular expressions no longer need to start with r'^(.*?)' and end with r'(.*?)%' . This runs faster. The returned match object will only contain what is explicitly matched in the pattern, and extension pattern groups now start with m.group(1) . The handleMatch method now takes an additional input called data , which is the entire block under analysis, not just what is matched with the specified pattern. The method now returns the element and the indexes relative to data that the return element is replacing (usually m.start(0) and m.end(0) ). If the boundaries are returned as None , it is assumed that the match did not take place, and nothing will be altered in data . This allows handling of more complex constructs than regular expressions can handle, e.g., matching nested brackets, and explicit control of the span \u201cconsumed\u201d by the processor. Inline Patterns \u00b6 Inline Patterns can implement inline HTML element syntax for Markdown such as *emphasis* or [links](http://example.com) . Pattern objects should be instances of classes that inherit from markdown.inlinepatterns.Pattern or one of its children. Each pattern object uses a single regular expression and must have the following methods: getCompiledRegExp() : Returns a compiled regular expression. handleMatch(m) : Accepts a match object and returns an ElementTree element of a plain Unicode string. Inline Patterns can define the property ANCESTOR_EXCLUDES with is either a list or tuple of undesirable ancestors. The pattern will be skipped if it would cause the content to be a descendant of one of the listed tag names. Note that any regular expression returned by getCompiledRegExp must capture the whole block. Therefore, they should all start with r'^(.*?)' and end with r'(.*?)!' . When using the default getCompiledRegExp() method provided in the Pattern you can pass in a regular expression without that and getCompiledRegExp will wrap your expression for you and set the re.DOTALL and re.UNICODE flags. This means that the first group of your match will be m.group(2) as m.group(1) will match everything before the pattern. For an example, consider this simplified emphasis pattern: from markdown.inlinepatterns import Pattern import xml.etree.ElementTree as etree class EmphasisPattern ( Pattern ): def handleMatch ( self , m ): el = etree . Element ( 'em' ) el . text = m . group ( 2 ) return el As discussed in Integrating Your Code Into Markdown , an instance of this class will need to be provided to Markdown. That instance would be created like so: # an oversimplified regex MYPATTERN = r '\\*([^*]+)\\*' # pass in pattern and create instance emphasis = EmphasisPattern ( MYPATTERN ) Postprocessors \u00b6 Postprocessors munge the document after the ElementTree has been serialized into a string. Postprocessors should be used to work with the text just before output. Usually, they are used add back sections that were extracted in a preprocessor, fix up outgoing encodings, or wrap the whole document. Postprocessors inherit from markdown.postprocessors.Postprocessor and implement a run method which takes a single parameter text , the entire HTML document as a single Unicode string. run should return a single Unicode string ready for output. Note that preprocessors use a list of lines while postprocessors use a single multi-line string. Example \u00b6 Here is a simple example that changes the output to one big page showing the raw html. from markdown.postprocessors import Postprocessor import re class ShowActualHtmlPostprocesor ( Postprocessor ): \"\"\" Wrap entire output in <pre> tags as a diagnostic. \"\"\" def run ( self , text ): return '<pre> \\n ' + re . sub ( '<' , '&lt;' , text ) + '</pre> \\n ' Usages \u00b6 Some postprocessors in the Markdown source tree include: Class Kind Description raw_html built-in Restore raw html from htmlStash , stored by HTMLBlockPreprocessor , and code highlighters amp_substitute built-in Convert ampersand substitutes to & ; used in links unescape built-in Convert some escaped characters back from integers; used in links FootnotePostProcessor extension Replace footnote placeholders with html entities; as set by other stages Working with the ElementTree \u00b6 As mentioned, the Markdown parser converts a source document to an ElementTree object before serializing that back to Unicode text. Markdown has provided some helpers to ease that manipulation within the context of the Markdown module. First, import the ElementTree module: import xml.etree.ElementTree as etree Sometimes you may want text inserted into an element to be parsed by [Inline Patterns][]. In such a situation, simply insert the text as you normally would and the text will be automatically run through the Inline Patterns. However, if you do not want some text to be parsed by Inline Patterns, then insert the text as an AtomicString . from markdown.util import AtomicString some_element . text = AtomicString ( some_text ) Here\u2019s a basic example which creates an HTML table (note that the contents of the second cell ( td2 ) will be run through Inline Patterns latter): table = etree . Element ( \"table\" ) table . set ( \"cellpadding\" , \"2\" ) # Set cellpadding to 2 tr = etree . SubElement ( table , \"tr\" ) # Add child tr to table td1 = etree . SubElement ( tr , \"td\" ) # Add child td1 to tr td1 . text = markdown . util . AtomicString ( \"Cell content\" ) # Add plain text content td2 = etree . SubElement ( tr , \"td\" ) # Add second td to tr td2 . text = \"*text* with **inline** formatting.\" # Add markup text table . tail = \"Text after table\" # Add text after table You can also manipulate an existing tree. Consider the following example which adds a class attribute to <a> elements: def set_link_class ( self , element ): for child in element : if child . tag == \"a\" : child . set ( \"class\" , \"myclass\" ) #set the class attribute set_link_class ( child ) # run recursively on children For more information about working with ElementTree see the ElementTree Documentation . Working with Raw HTML \u00b6 Occasionally an extension may need to call out to a third party library which returns a pre-made string of raw HTML that needs to be inserted into the document unmodified. Raw strings can be stashed for later retrieval using an htmlStash instance, rather than converting them into ElementTree objects. A raw string (which may or may not be raw HTML) passed to self.md.htmlStash.store() will be saved to the stash and a placeholder string will be returned which should be inserted into the tree instead. After the tree is serialized, a postprocessor will replace the placeholder with the raw string. This prevents subsequent processing steps from modifying the HTML data. For example, html = \"<p>This is some <em>raw</em> HTML data</p>\" el = etree . Element ( \"div\" ) el . text = self . md . htmlStash . store ( html ) For the global htmlStash instance to be available from a processor, the markdown.Markdown instance must be passed to the processor from extendMarkdown and will be available as self.md.htmlStash . Integrating Your Code Into Markdown \u00b6 Once you have the various pieces of your extension built, you need to tell Markdown about them and ensure that they are run in the proper sequence. Markdown accepts an Extension instance for each extension. Therefore, you will need to define a class that extends markdown.extensions.Extension and over-rides the extendMarkdown method. Within this class you will manage configuration options for your extension and attach the various processors and patterns to the Markdown instance. It is important to note that the order of the various processors and patterns matters. For example, if we replace http://... links with <a> elements, and then try to deal with inline HTML, we will end up with a mess. Therefore, the various types of processors and patterns are stored within an instance of the markdown.Markdown class in a Registry . Your Extension class will need to manipulate those registries appropriately. You may register instances of your processors and patterns with an appropriate priority, deregister built-in instances, or replace a built-in instance with your own. extendMarkdown \u00b6 The extendMarkdown method of a markdown.extensions.Extension class accepts one argument: md : A pointer to the instance of the markdown.Markdown class. You should use this to access the Registries of processors and patterns. They are found under the following attributes: md.preprocessors md.inlinePatterns md.parser.blockprocessors md.treeprocessors md.postprocessors Some other things you may want to access on the markdown.Markdown instance are: md.htmlStash md.output_formats md.set_output_format() md.output_format md.serializer md.registerExtension() md.tab_length md.block_level_elements md.isBlockLevel() Warning With access to the above items, theoretically you have the option to change anything through various monkey_patching techniques. However, you should be aware that the various undocumented parts of Markdown may change without notice and your monkey_patches may break with a new release. Therefore, what you really should be doing is inserting processors and patterns into the Markdown pipeline. Consider yourself warned! A simple example: from markdown.extensions import Extension class MyExtension ( Extension ): def extendMarkdown ( self , md ): # Register instance of 'mypattern' with a priority of 175 md . inlinePatterns . register ( MyPattern ( md ), 'mypattern' , 175 ) registerExtension \u00b6 Some extensions may need to have their state reset between multiple runs of the markdown.Markdown class. For example, consider the following use of the Footnotes extension: md = markdown . Markdown ( extensions = [ 'footnotes' ]) html1 = md . convert ( text_with_footnote ) md . reset () html2 = md . convert ( text_without_footnote ) Without calling reset , the footnote definitions from the first document will be inserted into the second document as they are still stored within the class instance. Therefore the Extension class needs to define a reset method that will reset the state of the extension (i.e.: self.footnotes = {} ). However, as many extensions do not have a need for reset , reset is only called on extensions that are registered. To register an extension, call md.registerExtension from within your extendMarkdown method: def extendMarkdown ( self , md ): md . registerExtension ( self ) # insert processors and patterns here Then, each time reset is called on the markdown.Markdown instance, the reset method of each registered extension will be called as well. You should also note that reset will be called on each registered extension after it is initialized the first time. Keep that in mind when over-riding the extension\u2019s reset method. Configuration Settings \u00b6 If an extension uses any parameters that the user may want to change, those parameters should be stored in self.config of your markdown.extensions.Extension class in the following format: class MyExtension ( markdown . extensions . Extension ): def __init__ ( self , ** kwargs ): self . config = { 'option1' : [ 'value1' , 'description1' ], 'option2' : [ 'value2' , 'description2' ] } super ( MyExtension , self ) . __init__ ( ** kwargs ) When implemented this way the configuration parameters can be over-ridden at run time (thus the call to super ). For example: markdown . Markdown ( extensions = [ MyExtension ( option1 = 'other value' )]) Note that if a keyword is passed in that is not already defined in self.config , then a KeyError is raised. The markdown.extensions.Extension class and its subclasses have the following methods available to assist in working with configuration settings: getConfig(key [, default]) : Returns the stored value for the given key or default if the key does not exist. If not set, default returns an empty string. getConfigs() : Returns a dict of all key/value pairs. getConfigInfo() : Returns all configuration descriptions as a list of tuples. setConfig(key, value) : Sets a configuration setting for key with the given value . If key is unknown, a KeyError is raised. If the previous value of key was a Boolean value, then value is converted to a Boolean value. If the previous value of key is None , then value is converted to a Boolean value except when it is None . No conversion takes place when the previous value of key is a string. setConfigs(items) : Sets multiple configuration settings given a dict of key/value pairs. Naming an Extension \u00b6 As noted in the library reference an instance of an extension can be passed directly to markdown.Markdown . In fact, this is the preferred way to use third-party extensions. For example: import markdown from path.to.module import MyExtension md = markdown . Markdown ( extensions = [ MyExtension ( option = 'value' )]) However, Markdown also accepts \u201cnamed\u201d third party extensions for those occasions when it is impractical to import an extension directly (from the command line or from within templates). A \u201cname\u201d can either be a registered entry point or a string using Python\u2019s dot notation . Entry Point \u00b6 Entry points are defined in a Python package\u2019s setup.py script. The script must use setuptools to support entry points. Python-Markdown extensions must be assigned to the markdown.extensions group. An entry point definition might look like this: from setuptools import setup setup ( # ... entry_points = { 'markdown.extensions' : [ 'myextension = path.to.module:MyExtension' ] } ) After a user installs your extension using the above script, they could then call the extension using the myextension string name like this: markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ 'myextension' ]) Note that if two or more entry points within the same group are assigned the same name, Python-Markdown will only ever use the first one found and ignore all others. Therefore, be sure to give your extension a unique name. For more information on writing setup.py scripts, see the Python documentation on Packaging and Distributing Projects . Dot Notation \u00b6 If an extension does not have a registered entry point, Python\u2019s dot notation may be used instead. The extension must be installed as a Python module on your PYTHONPATH. Generally, a class should be specified in the name. The class must be at the end of the name and be separated by a colon from the module. Therefore, if you were to import the class like this: from path.to.module import MyExtension Then the extension can be loaded as follows: markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ 'path.to.module:MyExtension' ]) You do not need to do anything special to support this feature. As long as your extension class is able to be imported, a user can include it with the above syntax. The above two methods are especially useful if you need to implement a large number of extensions with more than one residing in a module. However, if you do not want to require that your users include the class name in their string, you must define only one extension per module and that module must contain a module-level function called makeExtension that accepts **kwargs and returns an extension instance. For example: class MyExtension ( markdown . extensions . Extension ) # Define extension here... def makeExtension ( ** kwargs ): return MyExtension ( ** kwargs ) When markdown.Markdown is passed the \u201cname\u201d of your extension as a dot notation string that does not include a class (for example path.to.module ), it will import the module and call the makeExtension function to initiate your extension. Registries \u00b6 The markdown.util.Registry class is a priority sorted registry which Markdown uses internally to determine the processing order of its various processors and patterns. A Registry instance provides two public methods to alter the data of the registry: register and deregister . Use register to add items and deregister to remove items. See each method for specifics. When registering an item, a \u201cname\u201d and a \u201cpriority\u201d must be provided. All items are automatically sorted by the value of the \u201cpriority\u201d parameter such that the item with the highest value will be processed first. The \u201cname\u201d is used to remove ( deregister ) and get items. A Registry instance is like a list (which maintains order) when reading data. You may iterate over the items, get an item and get a count (length) of all items. You may also check that the registry contains an item. When getting an item you may use either the index of the item or the string-based \u201cname\u201d. For example: registry = Registry () registry . register ( SomeItem (), 'itemname' , 20 ) # Get the item by index item = registry [ 0 ] # Get the item by name item = registry [ 'itemname' ] When checking that the registry contains an item, you may use either the string-based \u201cname\u201d, or a reference to the actual item. For example: someitem = SomeItem () registry . register ( someitem , 'itemname' , 20 ) # Contains the name assert 'itemname' in registry # Contains the item instance assert someitem in registry markdown.util.Registry has the following methods: Registry.register(self, item, name, priority) \u00b6 Add an item to the registry with the given name and priority. Parameters: item : The item being registered. name : A string used to reference the item. priority : An integer or float used to sort against all items. If an item is registered with a \u201cname\u201d which already exists, the existing item is replaced with the new item. Tread carefully as the old item is lost with no way to recover it. The new item will be sorted according to its priority and will not retain the position of the old item. Registry.deregister(self, name, strict=True) \u00b6 Remove an item from the registry. Set strict=False to fail silently. Registry.get_index_for_name(self, name) \u00b6 Return the index of the given name .","title":"Extension API"},{"location":"extensions/api/#writing-extensions-for-python-markdown","text":"Python-Markdown includes an API for extension writers to plug their own custom functionality and syntax into the parser.

Postprocessors munge of the output of the parser just before it is returned. The parser loads text, applies the preprocessors, creates and builds an ElementTree object from the block processors and inline processors, renders the ElementTree object as Unicode text, and then then applies the postprocessors.

Blocks of text, separated from other text by blank lines, may have a different syntax and produce a differently structured tree than other Markdown. Block processors excel at code formatting, equation layouts, and tables. Block processors inherit from markdown.blockprocessors.BlockProcessor , are passed md.parser on initialization, and implement both the test and run methods: test(self, parent, block) takes two parameters: parent is the parent ElementTree element and block is a single, multi-line, Unicode string of the current block. test , often a regular expression match, returns a true value if the block processor\u2019s run method should be called to process starting at that block. run(self, parent, blocks) has the same parent parameter as test ; and blocks is the list of all remaining blocks in the document, starting with the block passed to test . run may return False (not None ) to signal failure, meaning that it did not process the blocks after all. On success, run is expected to pop one or more blocks from the front of blocks and attach new nodes to parent . Crafting block processors is more involved and flexible than the other processors, involving controlling recursive parsing of the block\u2019s contents and managing state across invocations. For example, a blank line is allowed in indented code, so the second invocation of the inline code processor appends to the element tree generated by the previous call. Other block processors may insert new text into the blocks list, signal to future calls of itself, and more. To make writing these complex beasts more tractable, three convenience functions have been provided by the BlockProcessor parent class: lastChild(parent) returns the last child of the given element or None if it has no children. detab(text) removes one level of indent (four spaces by default) from the front of each line of the given multi-line, text string, until a non-blank line is indented less. looseDetab(text, level) removes multiple levels of indent from the front of each line of text but does not affect lines indented less.

Be sure your code pops the states it pushes. The BlockParser instance can also be called recursively, that is, to process blocks from within your block processor. There are three methods: parseDocument(lines) parses a list of lines, each a single-line Unicode string, returning a complete ElementTree . parseChunk(parent, text) parses a single, multi-line, possibly multi-block, Unicode string text and attaches the resulting tree to parent . parseBlocks(parent, blocks) takes a list of blocks , each a multi-line Unicode string without blank lines, and attaches the resulting tree to parent .

In such a situation, simply insert the text as you normally would and the text will be automatically run through the Inline Patterns. However, if you do not want some text to be parsed by Inline Patterns, then insert the text as an AtomicString . from markdown.util import AtomicString some_element . text = AtomicString ( some_text ) Here\u2019s a basic example which creates an HTML table (note that the contents of the second cell ( td2 ) will be run through Inline Patterns latter): table = etree . Element ( \"table\" ) table . set ( \"cellpadding\" , \"2\" ) # Set cellpadding to 2 tr = etree . SubElement ( table , \"tr\" ) # Add child tr to table td1 = etree . SubElement ( tr , \"td\" ) # Add child td1 to tr td1 . text = markdown . util . AtomicString ( \"Cell content\" ) # Add plain text content td2 = etree . SubElement ( tr , \"td\" ) # Add second td to tr td2 . text = \"*text* with **inline** formatting.\" # Add markup text table . tail = \"Text after table\" # Add text after table You can also manipulate an existing tree. Consider the following example which adds a class attribute to <a> elements: def set_link_class ( self , element ): for child in element : if child . tag == \"a\" : child . set ( \"class\" , \"myclass\" ) #set the class attribute set_link_class ( child ) # run recursively on children For more information about working with ElementTree see the ElementTree Documentation .","title":"Working with the ElementTree"},{"location":"extensions/api/#working_with_raw_html","text":"Occasionally an extension may need to call out to a third party library which returns a pre-made string of raw HTML that needs to be inserted into the document unmodified. Raw strings can be stashed for later retrieval using an htmlStash instance, rather than converting them into ElementTree objects. A raw string (which may or may not be raw HTML) passed to self.md.htmlStash.store() will be saved to the stash and a placeholder string will be returned which should be inserted into the tree instead. After the tree is serialized, a postprocessor will replace the placeholder with the raw string. This prevents subsequent processing steps from modifying the HTML data. For example, html = \"<p>This is some <em>raw</em> HTML data</p>\" el = etree . Element ( \"div\" ) el . text = self . md . htmlStash . store ( html ) For the global htmlStash instance to be available from a processor, the markdown.Markdown instance must be passed to the processor from extendMarkdown and will be available as self.md.htmlStash .","title":"Working with Raw HTML"},{"location":"extensions/api/#integrating_into_markdown","text":"Once you have the various pieces of your extension built, you need to tell Markdown about them and ensure that they are run in the proper sequence. Markdown accepts an Extension instance for each extension. Therefore, you will need to define a class that extends markdown.extensions.Extension and over-rides the extendMarkdown method. Within this class you will manage configuration options for your extension and attach the various processors and patterns to the Markdown instance. It is important to note that the order of the various processors and patterns matters. For example, if we replace http://... links with <a> elements, and then try to deal with inline HTML, we will end up with a mess. Therefore, the various types of processors and patterns are stored within an instance of the markdown.Markdown class in a Registry . Your Extension class will need to manipulate those registries appropriately. You may register instances of your processors and patterns with an appropriate priority, deregister built-in instances, or replace a built-in instance with your own.","title":"Integrating Your Code Into Markdown"},{"location":"extensions/api/#extendmarkdown","text":"The extendMarkdown method of a markdown.extensions.Extension class accepts one argument: md : A pointer to the instance of the markdown.Markdown class.

However, you should be aware that the various undocumented parts of Markdown may change without notice and your monkey_patches may break with a new release. Therefore, what you really should be doing is inserting processors and patterns into the Markdown pipeline. Consider yourself warned!

Therefore the Extension class needs to define a reset method that will reset the state of the extension (i.e.: self.footnotes = {} ). However, as many extensions do not have a need for reset , reset is only called on extensions that are registered. To register an extension, call md.registerExtension from within your extendMarkdown method: def extendMarkdown ( self , md ): md . registerExtension ( self ) # insert processors and patterns here Then, each time reset is called on the markdown.Markdown instance, the reset method of each registered extension will be called as well.

The above two methods are especially useful if you need to implement a large number of extensions with more than one residing in a module. However, if you do not want to require that your users include the class name in their string, you must define only one extension per module and that module must contain a module-level function called makeExtension that accepts **kwargs and returns an extension instance.

When registering an item, a \u201cname\u201d and a \u201cpriority\u201d must be provided. All items are automatically sorted by the value of the \u201cpriority\u201d parameter such that the item with the highest value will be processed first.

This extension is included in the standard Markdown library. Syntax \u00b6 The basic syntax was inspired by Maruku\u2019s Attribute Lists feature (see web archive ). The List \u00b6 An example attribute list might look like this: {: #someid .someclass somekey='some value' } A word which starts with a hash ( # ) will set the id of an element. A word which starts with a dot ( . ) will be added to the list of classes assigned to an element. A key/value pair ( somekey='some value' ) will assign that pair to the element. Be aware that while the dot syntax will add to a class, using key/value pairs will always override the previously defined attribute. Consider the following: {: #id1 .class1 id=id2 class=\"class2 class3\" .class4 } The above example would result in the following attributes being defined: id=\"id2\" class=\"class2 class3 class4\" HTML includes support for some attributes to be a single term, like checked , for example. Therefore, the attribute list {: checked } would result in checked if the output format is html or checked=\"checked\" if the output format is xhtml . Curly braces can be backslash escaped to avoid being identified as an attribute list. \\{ not an attribute list } Opening and closing curly braces which are empty or only contain whitespace are ignored whether they are escaped or not. Additionally, any attribute lists which are not located in the specific locations documented below are ignored. The colon after the opening brace is optional, but is supported to maintain consistency with other implementations. Therefore, the following is also a valid attribute list: { #someid .someclass somekey='some value' } In addition, the spaces after the opening brace and before the closing brace are optional. They are recommended as they improve readability, but they are not required. The Attribute List extension does not have any knowledge of which keys and/or values are valid in HTML. Therefore, it is up to the document author to ensure that valid keys and values are used. However, the extension will escape any characters in the key which are not valid by replacing them with an underscore. Multiple consecutive invalid characters are reduced to a single underscore. Block Level \u00b6 To define attributes for a block level element, the attribute list should be defined on the last line of the block by itself. This is a paragraph. {: #an_id .a_class } The above results in the following output: < p id = \"an_id\" class = \"a_class\" > This is a paragraph. </ p > An exception is headers, as they are only ever allowed on one line. A setext style header {: #setext} ================================= ### A hash style header ### {: #hash } The above results in the following output: < h1 id = \"setext\" > A setext style header </ h1 > < h3 id = \"hash\" > A hash style header </ h3 > See Also By default, the Fenced Code Blocks extension includes limited support for attribute lists. To get full support , both extensions must be enabled. Inline \u00b6 To define attributes on inline elements, the attribute list should be defined immediately after the inline element with no white space. [link](http://example.com){: class=\"foo bar\" title=\"Some title!\" } The above results in the following output: < p >< a href = \"http://example.com\" class = \"foo bar\" title = \"Some title!\" > link </ a ></ p > If the tables extension is enabled, attribute lists can be defined on table cells. To differentiate attributes for an inline element from attributes for the containing cell, the attribute list must be separated from the content by at least one space and be defined at the end of the cell content. As table cells can only ever be on a single line, the attribute list must remain on the same line as the content of the cell. | set on td | set on em | |--------------|-------------| | *a* { .foo } | *b*{ .foo } | The above example results in the following output: < table > < thead > < tr > < th > set on td </ th > < th > set on em </ th > </ tr > </ thead > < tbody > < tr > < td class = \"foo\" >< em > a </ em ></ td > < td >< em class = \"foo\" > b </ em ></ td > </ tr > </ tbody > </ table > Note that in the first column, the attribute list is preceded by a space; therefore, it is assigned to the table cell ( <td> element). However, in the second column, the attribute list is not preceded by a space; therefore, it is assigned to the inline element ( <em> ) which immediately preceded it. Attribute lists may also be defined on table header cells ( <th> elements) in the same manner. Limitations \u00b6 There are a few types of elements which attribute lists do not work with. As a reminder, Markdown is a subset of HTML and anything which cannot be expressed in Markdown can always be expressed with raw HTML directly. Code Blocks: Code blocks are unique in that they must be able to display Markdown syntax. Therefore, there is no way to determine if an attribute list is intended to be part of the code block or intended to define attributes on the wrapping element. For that reason, the extension ignores code blocks. To define attributes on code blocks, the codehilite and fenced code blocks extensions provide some options. Nested Elements: Markdown provides mechanisms for nesting various block level elements within other elements. However, attribute lists only ever get applied to the immediate parent. There is no way to specify that an attribute list should be applied some number of levels up the document tree. For example, when including an attribute list within a blockquote, the attribute list is only ever applied to the paragraph the list is defined in. There is no way to define attributes on the blockquote element itself. Implied Elements: There are various HTML elements which are not represented in Markdown text, but only implied. For example, the ul and ol elements do not exist in Markdown. They are only implied by the presence of list items ( li ). There is no way to use an attribute list to define attributes on implied elements, including but not limited to the following: ul , ol , dl , table , thead , tbody , and tr .

This extension is included in the standard Markdown library. Setup \u00b6 Step 1: Download and Install Pygments \u00b6 You will also need to download and install the Pygments package on your PYTHONPATH . The CodeHilite extension will produce HTML output without Pygments, but it won\u2019t highlight anything (same behavior as setting use_pygments to False ). Step 2: Add CSS Classes \u00b6 You will need to define the appropriate CSS classes with appropriate rules. The CSS rules either need to be defined in or linked from the header of your HTML templates. Pygments can generate CSS rules for you. Just run the following command from the command line: pygmentize -S default -f html -a .codehilite > styles.css If you are using a different css_class (default: .codehilite ), then set the value of the -a option to that class name. The CSS rules will be written to the styles.css file which you can copy to your site and link from your HTML templates. If you would like to use a different theme, swap out default for the desired theme. For a list of themes installed on your system (additional themes can be installed via Pygments plugins), run the following command: pygmentize -L style See Pygments\u2019 excellent documentation for more details. If no language is defined, Pygments will attempt to guess the language. When that fails, the code block will not be highlighted. See Also GitHub user richeland has provided a number of different CSS style sheets which work with Pygments along with a preview of each theme. The css_class used is .highlight . Therefore, one would need to override the css_class option when using richeland\u2019s CSS styles. However, the Python-Markdown project makes no guarantee that richeland\u2019s CSS styles will work with the version of Pygments you are using. To ensure complete compatibility, you should generate the CSS rules from your own installation of Pygments. Syntax \u00b6 The CodeHilite extension follows the same syntax as regular Markdown code blocks, with one exception. The highlighter needs to know what language to use for the code block. There are three ways to tell the highlighter what language the code block contains and each one has a different result. Note The format of the language identifier only effects the display of line numbers if linenums is set to None (the default). If set to True or False (see Usage below) the format of the identifier has no effect on the display of line numbers \u2013 it only serves as a means to define the language of the code block. Shebang (with path) \u00b6 If the first line of the code block contains a shebang, the language is derived from that and line numbers are used. #!/usr/bin/python # Code goes here ... Will result in: 1 2 #!/usr/bin/python # Code goes here ... Shebang (no path) \u00b6 If the first line contains a shebang, but the shebang line does not contain a path (a single / or even a space), then that line is removed from the code block before processing. Line numbers are used. #!python # Code goes here ... Will result in: 1 # Code goes here ... Colons \u00b6 If the first line begins with three or more colons, the text following the colons identifies the language. The first line is removed from the code block before processing and line numbers are not used. :::python # Code goes here ... Will result in: # Code goes here ... Certain lines can be selected for emphasis with the colon syntax. When using Pygments\u2019 default CSS styles, emphasized lines have a yellow background. This is useful to direct the reader\u2019s attention to specific lines. :::python hl_lines=\"1 3\" # This line is emphasized # This line isn't # This line is emphasized Will result in: # This line is emphasized # This line isn't # This line is emphasized Note hl_lines is named for Pygments\u2019 option meaning \u201chighlighted lines\u201d. When No Language is Defined \u00b6 CodeHilite is completely backwards compatible so that if a code block is encountered that does not define a language, the block is simply wrapped in <pre> tags and output. # Code goes here ... Will result in: # Code goes here ... Lets see the source for that: < div class = \"codehilite\" >< pre >< code > # Code goes here ... </ code ></ pre ></ div > Note When no language is defined, the Pygments highlighting engine will try to guess the language (unless guess_lang is set to False ). Upon failure, the same behavior will happen as described above. Usage \u00b6 See Extensions for general extension usage. Use codehilite as the name of the extension. See the Library Reference for information about configuring extensions. The following options are provided to configure the output: linenums : An alias to Pygments\u2019 linenos formatter option. Possible values are True for yes, False for no and None for auto. Defaults to None . Using True will force every code block to have line numbers, even when using colons ( ::: ) for language identification. Using False will turn off all line numbers, even when using shebangs ( #! ) for language identification. guess_lang : Automatic language detection. Defaults to True . Using False will prevent Pygments from guessing the language, and thus highlighting blocks only when you explicitly set the language. css_class : An alias to Pygments cssclass formatter option. Set CSS class name for the wrapper <div> tag. Defaults to codehilite . pygments_style : Pygments HTML Formatter Style ( ColorScheme ). Defaults to default . Note This is useful only when noclasses is set to True , otherwise the CSS styles must be provided by the end user. noclasses : Use inline styles instead of CSS classes. Defaults to False . use_pygments : Specifies the use of Pygments in generating the output. If True (the default) and Pygments is available, CodeHilite will use Pygments to analyze and format the output. Additionally, if using Pygments >= 2.4, the output will be wrapped in <code> tags, whereas earlier versions will not. Otherwise, Pygments will not be used. If a language is defined for a code block, it will be assigned to the <code> tag as a class in the manner suggested by the HTML5 spec and may be used by a JavaScript library in the browser to highlight the code block. See the lang_prefix option to customize the prefix. lang_prefix : The prefix prepended to the language class assigned to the HTML <code> tag. Default: language- . This option only applies when use_pygments is False as Pygments does not provide an option to include a language prefix.

This extension is included in the standard Markdown library. Syntax \u00b6 Fenced Code Blocks are defined using the syntax originally established in PHP Markdown Extra and popularized by GitHub Flavored Markdown . Fenced code blocks begin with three or more backticks ( ``` ) or tildes ( ~~~ ) on a line by themselves and end with a matching set of backticks or tildes on a line by themselves. The closing set must contain the same number and type of characters as the opening set. It is recommended that a blank line be placed before and after the code block. A paragraph before the code block. ``` a one-line code block ``` A paragraph after the code block. While backticks seem to be more popular among users, tildes may be used as well. ~~~ a one-line code block ~~~ To include a set of backticks (or tildes) within a code block, use a different number of backticks for the deliminators. ```` ``` ```` Fenced code blocks can have a blank line as the first and/or last line of the code block and those lines will be preserved. ``` a three-line code block ``` Unlike indented code blocks, a fenced code block can immediately follow a list item without becoming part of the list. * A list item. ``` not part of the list ``` Warning Fenced Code Blocks are only supported at the document root level. Therefore, they cannot be nested inside lists or blockquotes. If you need to nest fenced code blocks, you may want to try the third party extension SuperFences instead. Attributes \u00b6 Various attributes may be defined on a per-code-block basis by defining them immediately following the opening deliminator. The attributes should be wrapped in curly braces {} and be on the same line as the deliminator. It is generally best to separate the attribute list from the deliminator with a space. Attributes within the list must be separated by a space. ``` { attributes go here } a code block with attributes ``` How those attributes will affect the output will depend on various factors as described below. Language \u00b6 The language of the code within a code block can be specified for use by syntax highlighters, etc. The language should be prefixed with a dot and not contain any whitespace ( .language-name ). ``` { .html } <p>HTML Document</p> ``` So long as the language is the only option specified, the curly brackets and/or the dot may be excluded: ``` html <p>HTML Document</p> ``` Either of the above examples will output the following HTML: < pre >< code class = \"language-html\" > &lt; p &gt; HTML Document &lt; /p &gt; </ code ></ pre > Note that the language name has been prefixed with language- and it has been assigned to the class attribute on the <code> tag, which is the format suggested by the HTML 5 Specification (see the second \u201cexample\u201d in the Specification). While language is the default prefix, the prefix may be overridden using the lang_prefix configuration option. Classes \u00b6 In addition to the language, additional classes may be defined by prefixing them with a dot, just like the language. ``` { .html .foo .bar } <p>HTML Document</p> ``` When defining multiple classes, only the first class will be used as the \u201clanguage\u201d for the code block. All others are assigned to the <pre> tag unaltered. Additionally, the curly braces and dot are required for all classes, including the language class if more than one class is defined. The above example will output the following HTML: < pre class = \"foo bar\" >< code class = \"language-html\" > &lt; p &gt; HTML Document &lt; /p &gt; </ code ></ pre > ID \u00b6 An id can be defined for a code block, which would allow a link to point directly to the code block using a URL hash. IDs must be prefixed with a hash character ( # ) and only contain characters permitted in HTML id attributes. ``` { #example } A linkable code block ``` The id attribute is assigned to the <pre> tag of the output. The above example will output the following HTML: < pre id = \"example\" >< code > A linkable code block </ code ></ pre > From elsewhere within the same document, one could link to the code block with [link](#example) . IDs may be defined along with the language, other classes, or any other supported attributes. The order of items does not matter. ``` { #example .lang .foo .bar } A linkable code block ``` Key/Value Pairs \u00b6 If the fenced_code and attr_list extensions are both enabled, then key/value pairs can be defined in the attribute list. So long as code highlighting is not enabled (see below), the key/value pairs will be assigned as attributes on the <code> tag in the output. Key/value pairs must be defined using the syntax documented for the attr_list extension (for example, values with whitespace must be wrapped in quotes). ``` { .lang #example style=\"color: #333 ; background: #f8f8f8 ;\" } A code block with inline styles. Fancy! ``` The above example will output the following HTML: < pre id = \"example\" >< code class = \"language-lang\" style = \"color: #333; background: #f8f8f8;\" > A code block with inline styles. Fancy! </ code ></ pre > If the attr_list extension is not enabled, then the key/value pairs will be ignored. Syntax Highlighting \u00b6 If the fenced_code extension and syntax highlighting are both enabled, then the codehilite extension will be used for syntax highlighting the contents of the code block. The language defined in the attribute list will be passed to codehilite to ensure that the correct language is used. If no language is specified and language guessing is not disabled for the codehilite extension, then the language will be guessed. The codehilite extension uses the Pygments engine to do syntax highlighting. Any valid Pygments options can be defined as key/value pairs in the attribute list and will be passed on to Pygments. ``` { .lang linenos=true linenostart=42 hl_lines=\"43-44 50\" title=\"An Example Code Block\" }` A truncated code block... ``` Valid options include any option accepted by Pygments\u2019 HTMLFormatter except for the full option, as well as any options accepted by the relevant lexer (each language has its own lexer). While most lexers don\u2019t have options that are all that useful in this context, there are a few important exceptions. For example, the PHP lexer\u2019s startinline option eliminates the need to start each code fragment with <?php . Note The fenced_code extension does not alter the output provided by Pygments. Therefore, only options which Pygments provides can be utilized. As Pygments does not currently provide a way to define an ID, any ID defined in an attribute list will be ignored when syntax highlighting is enabled. Additionally, any key/value pairs which are not Pygments options will be ignored, regardless of whether the attr_list extension is enabled. Enabling Syntax Highlighting \u00b6 To enable syntax highlighting, the codehilite extension must be enabled and the codehilite extension\u2019s use_pygments option must be set to True (the default). Alternatively, so long as the codehilite extension is enabled, you can override a global use_pygments=False option for an individual code block by including use_pygments=true in the attribute list. While the use_pygments key/value pair will not be included in the output, all other attributes will behave as they would if syntax highlighting was enabled only for that code block. Conversely, to disable syntax highlighting on an individual code block, include use_pygments=false in the attribute list. While the use_pygments key/value pair will not be included in the output, all other attributes will behave as they would if syntax highlighting was disabled for that code block regardless of any global setting. See Also You will need to properly install and setup Pygments for syntax highlighting to work. See the codehilite extension\u2019s documentation for details.

[ ^@#$% ]: A footnote on the label: \"@#$%\". A footnote label must start with a caret ^ and may contain any inline text (including spaces) between a set of square brackets [] . Only the first caret has any special meaning. A footnote content must start with the label followed by a colon and at least one space. The label used to define the content must exactly match the label used in the body (including capitalization and white space). The content would then follow the label either on the same line or on the next line. The content may contain multiple lines, paragraphs, code blocks, blockquotes and most any other markdown syntax. The additional lines must be indented one level (four spaces or one tab). When working with multiple blocks, it may be helpful to start the content on a separate line from the label which defines the content.

Only the first caret has any special meaning. A footnote content must start with the label followed by a colon and at least one space. The label used to define the content must exactly match the label used in the body (including capitalization and white space). The content would then follow the label either on the same line or on the next line. The content may contain multiple lines, paragraphs, code blocks, blockquotes and most any other markdown syntax. The additional lines must be indented one level (four spaces or one tab).

Syntax \u00b6 By default, Markdown ignores any content within a raw HTML block-level element. With the md-in-html extension enabled, the content of a raw HTML block-level element can be parsed as Markdown by including a markdown attribute on the opening tag. The markdown attribute will be stripped from the output, while all other attributes will be preserved. The markdown attribute can be assigned one of three values: \"1\" , \"block\" , or \"span\" . Note The expressions \u201cblock-level\u201d and \u201cspan-level\u201d as used in this document refer to an element\u2019s designation according to the HTML specification. Whereas the \"span\" and \"block\" values assigned to the markdown attribute refer to the Markdown parser\u2019s behavior. markdown=\"1\" \u00b6 When the markdown attribute is set to \"1\" , then the parser will use the default behavior for that specific tag. The following tags have the block behavior by default: article , aside , blockquote , body , colgroup , details , div , dl , fieldset , figcaption , figure , footer , form , group , header , hgroup , hr , iframe , main , map , menu , nav , noscript , object , ol , output , progress , section , table , tbody , tfoot , thead , tr , ul and video . For example, the following: <div markdown= \"1\" > This is a *Markdown* Paragraph. </div> \u2026 is rendered as: < div > < p > This is a < em > Markdown </ em > Paragraph. </ p > </ div > The following tags have the span behavior by default: address , dd , dt , h[1-6] , legend , li , p , td , and th . For example, the following: <p markdown= \"1\" > This is not a *Markdown* Paragraph. </p> \u2026 is rendered as: < p > This is not a < em > Markdown </ em > Paragraph. </ p > markdown=\"block\" \u00b6 When the markdown attribute is set to \"block\" , then the parser will force the block behavior on the contents of the element so long as it is one of the block or span tags. The content of a block element is parsed into block-level content. In other words, the text is rendered as paragraphs, headers, lists, blockquotes, etc. Any inline syntax within those elements is processed as well. For example, the following: <section markdown= \"block\" > # A header. A *Markdown* paragraph. * A list item. * A second list item. </section> \u2026 is rendered as: < section > < h1 > A header. </ h1 > < p > A < em > Markdown </ em > paragraph. </ p > < ul > < li > A list item. </ li > < li > A second list item. </ li > </ ul > </ section > Warning Forcing elements to be parsed as block elements when they are not by default could result in invalid HTML. For example, one could force a <p> element to be nested within another <p> element. In most cases it is recommended to use the default behavior of markdown=\"1\" . Explicitly setting markdown=\"block\" should be reserved for advanced users who understand the HTML specification and how browsers parse and render HTML. markdown=\"span\" \u00b6 When the markdown attribute is set to \"span\" , then the parser will force the span behavior on the contents of the element so long as it is one of the block or span tags. The content of a span element is not parsed into block-level content. In other words, the content will not be rendered as paragraphs, headers, etc. Only inline syntax will be rendered, such as links, strong, emphasis, etc. For example, the following: <div markdown= \"span\" > # *Not* a header </div> \u2026 is rendered as: < div > # < em > Not </ em > a header </ div > Ignored Elements \u00b6 The following tags are always ignored, regardless of any markdown attribute: canvas , math , option , pre , script , style , and textarea . All other raw HTML tags are treated as span-level tags and are not affected by this extension. Nesting \u00b6 When nesting multiple levels of raw HTML elements, a markdown attribute must be defined for each block-level element. For any block-level element which does not have a markdown attribute, everything inside that element is ignored, including child elements with markdown attributes. For example, the following: <article id= \"my-article\" markdown= \"1\" > # Article Title A Markdown paragraph. <section id= \"section-1\" markdown= \"1\" > ## Section 1 Title <p> Custom raw **HTML** which gets ignored. </p> </section> <section id= \"section-2\" markdown= \"1\" > ## Section 2 Title <p markdown= \"1\" > **Markdown** content. </p> </section> </article> \u2026 is rendered as: < article id = \"my-article\" > < h1 > Article Title </ h1 > < p > A Markdown paragraph. </ p > < section id = \"section-1\" > < h2 > Section 1 Title </ h2 > < p > Custom raw **HTML** which gets ignored. </ p > </ section > < section id = \"section-2\" > < h2 > Section 2 Title </ h2 > < p >< strong > Markdown </ strong > content. </ p > </ section > </ article > When the value of an element\u2019s markdown attribute is more permissive that its parent, then the parent\u2019s stricter behavior is enforced. For example, a block element nested within a span element will be parsed using the span behavior. However, if the value of an element\u2019s markdown attribute is the same as, or more restrictive than, its parent, the the child element\u2019s behavior is observed. For example, a block element may contain either block elements or span elements as children and each element will be parsed using the specified behavior. Tag Normalization \u00b6 While the default behavior is for Markdown to not alter raw HTML, as this extension is parsing the content of raw HTML elements, it will do some normalization of the tags of block-level elements. For example, the following raw HTML: <div markdown= \"1\" > <p markdown= \"1\" > A Markdown paragraph with *no* closing tag. <p> A raw paragraph with *no* closing tag. </div> \u2026 is rendered as: < div > < p > A Markdown paragraph with < em > no </ em > closing tag. </ p > < p > A raw paragraph with *no* closing tag. </ p > </ div > Notice that the parser properly recognizes that an unclosed <p> tag ends when another <p> tag begins or when the parent element ends. In both cases, a closing </p> was added to the end of the element, regardless of whether a markdown attribute was assigned to the element. To avoid any normalization, an element must not be a descendant of any block-level element which has a markdown attribute defined. Warning The normalization behavior is only documented here so that document authors are not surprised when their carefully crafted raw HTML is altered by Markdown. This extension should not be relied on to normalize and generate valid HTML. For the best results, always include valid raw HTML (with both opening and closing tags) in your Markdown documents.

This extension is included in the standard Markdown library. Syntax \u00b6 Sane Lists do not allow the mixing of list types. In other words, an ordered list will not continue when an unordered list item is encountered and vice versa. For example: 1. Ordered item 1 2. Ordered item 2 * Unordered item 1 * Unordered item 2 will result in the following output: < ol > < li > Ordered item 1 </ li > < li > Ordered item 2 </ li > </ ol > < ul > < li > Unordered item 1 </ li > < li > Unordered item 2 </ li > </ ul > Whereas the default Markdown behavior would be to generate an unordered list. Note that, unlike the default Markdown behavior, if a blank line is not included between list items, the different list type is ignored completely. This corresponds to the behavior of paragraphs. For example: A Paragraph. * Not a list item. 1. Ordered list item. * Not a separate list item. With this extension the above will result in the following output: < p > A Paragraph. * Not a list item. </ p > < ol > < li > Ordered list item. * Not a separate list item. </ li > </ ol > Sane lists also recognize the number used in ordered lists.

This extension is included in the standard Markdown library. Syntax \u00b6 By default, all headers will automatically have unique id attributes generated based upon the text of the header. Note this example, in which all three headers would have the same id : # Header # Header # Header Results in: < h1 id = \"header\" > Header </ h1 > < h1 id = \"header_1\" > Header </ h1 > < h1 id = \"header_2\" > Header </ h1 > Place a marker in the document where you would like the Table of Contents to appear. Then, a nested list of all the headers in the document will replace the marker. The marker defaults to [TOC] so the following document: [TOC] # Header 1 ## Header 2 would generate the following output: < div class = \"toc\" > < ul > < li >< a href = \"#header-1\" > Header 1 </ a ></ li > < ul > < li >< a href = \"#header-2\" > Header 2 </ a ></ li > </ ul > </ ul > </ div > < h1 id = \"header-1\" > Header 1 </ h1 > < h2 id = \"header-2\" > Header 2 </ h2 > Regardless of whether a marker is found in the document (or disabled), the Table of Contents is available as an attribute ( toc ) on the Markdown class. This allows one to insert the Table of Contents elsewhere in their page template. For example: >>> md = markdown . Markdown ( extensions = [ 'toc' ]) >>> html = md . convert ( text ) >>> page = render_some_template ( context = { 'body' : html , 'toc' : md . toc }) The toc_tokens attribute is also available on the Markdown class and contains a nested list of dict objects. For example, the above document would result in the following object at md.toc_tokens : [ { 'level' : 1 , 'id' : 'header-1' , 'name' : 'Header 1' , 'children' : [ { 'level' : 2 , 'id' : 'header-2' , 'name' : 'Header 2' , 'children' :[]} ] } ] Note that the level refers to the hn level. In other words, <h1> is level 1 and <h2> is level 2 , etc. Be aware that improperly nested levels in the input may result in odd nesting of the output. Custom Labels \u00b6 In most cases, the text label in the Table of Contents should match the text of the header. However, occasionally that is not desirable. In that case, if this extension is used in conjunction with the Attribute Lists Extension and a data-toc-label attribute is defined on the header, then the contents of that attribute will be used as the text label for the item in the Table of Contents. For example, the following Markdown: [TOC] # Functions ## `markdown.markdown(text [, **kwargs])` { #markdown data-toc-label='markdown.markdown' } would generate the following output: < div class = \"toc\" > < ul > < li >< a href = \"#functions\" > Functions </ a ></ li > < ul > < li >< a href = \"#markdown\" > markdown.markdown </ a ></ li > </ ul > </ ul > </ div > < h1 id = \"functions\" > Functions </ h1 > < h2 id = \"markdown\" >< code > markdown.markdown(text [, **kwargs]) </ code ></ h2 > Notice that the text in the Table of Contents is much cleaner and easier to read in the context of a Table of Contents. The data-toc-label is not included in the HTML header element. Also note that the ID was manually defined in the attribute list to provide a cleaner URL when linking to the header. If the ID is not manually defined, it is always derived from the text of the header, never from the data-toc-label attribute. Usage \u00b6 See Extensions for general extension usage. Use toc as the name of the extension. See the Library Reference for information about configuring extensions. The following options are provided to configure the output: marker : Text to find and replace with the Table of Contents. Defaults to [TOC] . Set to an empty string to disable searching for a marker, which may save some time, especially on long documents. title : Title to insert in the Table of Contents\u2019 <div> . Defaults to None . anchorlink : Set to True to cause all headers to link to themselves. Default is False . anchorlink_class : CSS class(es) used for the link. Defaults to toclink . permalink : Set to True or a string to generate permanent links at the end of each header. Useful with Sphinx style sheets. When set to True the paragraph symbol (\u00b6 or \u201c &para; \u201d) is used as the link text. When set to a string, the provided string is used as the link text. permalink_class : CSS class(es) used for the link. Defaults to headerlink . permalink_title : Title attribute of the permanent link. Defaults to Permanent link . baselevel : Base level for headers. Defaults to 1 . The baselevel setting allows the header levels to be automatically adjusted to fit within the hierarchy of your HTML templates. For example, suppose the Markdown text for a page should not contain any headers higher than level 3 ( <h3> ). The following will accomplish that: >>> text = ''' ... #Some Header ... ## Next Level''' >>> from markdown.extensions.toc import TocExtension >>> html = markdown . markdown ( text , extensions = [ TocExtension ( baselevel = 3 )]) >>> print html <h3 id=\"some_header\">Some Header</h3> <h4 id=\"next_level\">Next Level</h4>' slugify : Callable to generate anchors. Default: markdown.extensions.headerid.slugify In order to use a different algorithm to define the id attributes, define and pass in a callable which takes the following two arguments: value : The string to slugify. separator : The Word Separator. The callable must return a string appropriate for use in HTML id attributes. An alternate version of the default callable supporting Unicode strings is also provided as markdown.extensions.headerid.slugify_unicode . separator : Word separator. Character which replaces white space in id. Defaults to \u201c - \u201d. toc_depth Define the range of section levels to include in the Table of Contents. A single integer ( b ) defines the bottom section level ( <h1>..<hb> ) only. A string consisting of two digits separated by a hyphen in between ( \"2-5\" ), define the top ( t ) and the bottom ( b ) ( <ht>..<hb> ). Defaults to 6 (bottom). When used with conjunction with baselevel , this parameter will not take the fitted hierarchy from baselevel into account. That is, if both toc_depth and baselevel are 3 , then only the highest level will be present in the table. If you set baselevel to 3 and toc_depth to \"2-6\" , the first headline will be <h3> and so still included in the Table of Contents.
